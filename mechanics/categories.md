## Notes

- Economic extended its lead to 56 appearances (37.3% of all 150 games), gaining 9 new entries in the 126-150 range (Dwellings of Eldervale, Architects of the West Kingdom, Keyflower, Caylus, Troyes, Age of Steam, Galactic Cruise, Mombasa, Nucleum). Economic remains the single most dominant category by a wide margin, present in more than a third of all top-ranked games.
- Medieval surged from 7 to 15, more than doubling its count and jumping from Moderate Presence into Dominant Themes. Eight new medieval games appeared (Architects of the West Kingdom, Dominion: Intrigue, Raiders of the North Sea, Tainted Grail, Caylus, Troyes, Dominion, Hansa Teutonica), reflecting the concentration of worker placement and card game designs with medieval settings in this range.
- Fighting rose from 19 to 24, crossing into Dominant Themes. Five new entries (Dwellings of Eldervale, Tainted Grail, Eldritch Horror, LOTR: Journeys in Middle-Earth, Aeon's End: War Eternal) reflect the continued presence of combat-oriented cooperative and hybrid designs.
- Novel-based jumped from 7 to 11, moving from Moderate Presence to Strong Presence. Four new entries (Wonderland's War, Eldritch Horror, LOTR: Fate of the Fellowship, LOTR: Journeys in Middle-Earth) reflect the clustering of literary adaptations in this range.
- Abstract Strategy rose from 2 to 4 (Tigris & Euphrates, Patchwork), moving from Minor Presence to Moderate Presence. Negotiation similarly rose from 3 to 4 (Twilight Imperium 3E), and Transportation from 2 to 4 (Age of Steam, Nucleum), all crossing into Moderate Presence.
- Renaissance doubled from 1 to 2 (Lorenzo il Magnifico) and Trains from 1 to 2 (Age of Steam), both moving from Singular Appearances to Minor Presence. Travel rose from 2 to 3 (Eldritch Horror), remaining in Minor Presence.
- No entirely new categories appeared in the 126-150 expansion. The total unique category count remains at 61, suggesting the category landscape is stabilizing as the dataset grows. The long tail persists: 20 categories appear only once, roughly 33% of all unique categories, down slightly from 36% at 125 games.
