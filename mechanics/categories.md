## Notes

- Economic extended its lead to 47 appearances (37.6% of all 125 games), present in more than a third of all top-ranked games. This reflects the dominance of resource-conversion engines as a core design framework in modern hobby games.
- Card Game nearly doubled from 16 to 25, reflecting the wave of card-driven designs in the 101-125 range (Aeon's End, SCOUT, Concordia Venus, 7 Wonders, Decrypto, Arkham Horror Revised, Inis, Wyrmspan).
- Exploration surged from 14 to 20, crossing into Dominant Themes -- driven by adventure and discovery games clustering in the lower rankings (Robinson Crusoe, Quest for El Dorado, Inis, Battlestar Galactica).
- Ancient leapt from 3 to 8 appearances, driven by historical Mediterranean games (Concordia Venus, Teotihuacan, 7 Wonders, Ra, Inis).
- The long tail remains striking: 22 categories appear only once, roughly 36% of all unique categories. Four new singular categories appeared in the expanded dataset (Bluffing, Movies / TV, Renaissance, Word Game).
