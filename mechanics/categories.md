## Notes

- Science Fiction and Fantasy together account for 20 of 25 games, though many games carry both a thematic and a structural category (e.g., Economic + Science Fiction).
- "Card Game" as a category overlaps heavily with card-driven mechanics but denotes games where cards are the primary component rather than a subsystem.
- Licensed IP games (Dune, Star Wars, LotR) consistently rank high, suggesting strong theme-mechanic integration matters.
