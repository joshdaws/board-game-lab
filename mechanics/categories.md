## Notes

- Economic is the runaway leader at 37 appearances, present in over a third of all top-100 games. This reflects the dominance of resource-conversion engines as a core design framework in modern hobby games.
- Fantasy and Science Fiction remain the two strongest thematic categories (25 and 20 respectively), but their combined share relative to the dataset has dropped from 80% (top 25) to 45% (top 100), indicating that deeper into the rankings the theme palette diversifies considerably.
- Animals (16) and Farming (10) have surged from near-invisibility in the top 25 to dominant/strong presence across 100 games, pointing to a wave of nature-themed designs that rank well but cluster outside the very top tier.
- The long tail is striking: 23 categories appear only once, meaning roughly 40% of all unique categories are represented by a single game. Highly ranked games reward distinctive thematic identity rather than clustering around a few safe genres.
