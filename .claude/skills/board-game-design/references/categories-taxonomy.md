## Notes

- Economic grew from 61 to 66 appearances (33.0% of all 200 games), adding five entries in the 176-200 range (It's a Wonderful World, Stone Age, Istanbul, Glen More II: Chronicles, Marco Polo II). It remains the single most dominant category by a wide margin and now appears in one-third of all games in the dataset.
- Fantasy surged from 41 to 48 with seven new entries (Res Arcana, Cartographers, LotR: Fellowship Trick-Taking, LotR: The Card Game, The Isle of Cats, Unmatched: Cobble & Fog, Kemet), widening its lead as the second most common category. Fantasy now appears in nearly one-quarter of all 200 games.
- Science Fiction grew from 38 to 44 with six new entries (It's a Wonderful World, Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition, Andromeda's Edge, Legendary Encounters: Alien, Xia, Star Wars: Outer Rim), maintaining its position as the third most common category.
- Card Game jumped from 34 to 43 with nine new entries, the largest single-category increase in this expansion (Dominion: Second Edition, Res Arcana, It's a Wonderful World, LotR: Fellowship Trick-Taking, Watergate, LotR: The Card Game, Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition, Unmatched: Cobble & Fog, Legendary Encounters: Alien). This 26% increase reflects a heavy concentration of card-driven designs in the 176-200 range.
- Adventure and Fighting both grew from 30 to 34, remaining tied. Adventure added four entries (LotR: Fellowship Trick-Taking, LotR: The Card Game, Xia, Star Wars: Outer Rim); Fighting also added four (Andromeda's Edge, Unmatched: Cobble & Fog, Legendary Encounters: Alien, Xia).
- Medieval rose from 16 to 21 with five new entries (Dominion: Second Edition, War Chest, Praga Caput Regni, Viscounts of the West Kingdom, Marco Polo II), climbing from a borderline Dominant Theme to firmly within the tier and tying with Animals.
- Novel-based rose from 12 to 16 (LotR: Fellowship Trick-Taking, LotR: The Card Game, Unmatched: Cobble & Fog, Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective), crossing from Strong Presence into Dominant Themes. The Tolkien license alone contributed two of these four entries.
- Space Exploration rose from 20 to 24 (Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition, Andromeda's Edge, Xia, Star Wars: Outer Rim), remaining solidly in Dominant Themes. Territory Building rose from 16 to 19 (Cartographers, Andromeda's Edge, Glen More II: Chronicles), also staying in Dominant Themes.
- Wargame grew from 11 to 14 (Undaunted: Normandy, War Chest, Kemet), strengthening its Strong Presence position. Horror grew from 11 to 13 (Unmatched: Cobble & Fog, Legendary Encounters: Alien). Political rose from 12 to 13 (Watergate). Dice grew from 9 to 11 (Stone Age, Marco Polo II). Farming grew from 10 to 11 (Glen More II: Chronicles).
- Deduction rose from 7 to 8 (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective), crossing from Moderate Presence into Strong Presence.
- Movies / TV / Radio theme grew from 1 to 3 (Legendary Encounters: Alien, Star Wars: Outer Rim), moving from Singular Appearances to Minor Presence. Collectible Components doubled from 1 to 2 (LotR: The Card Game), Murder / Mystery doubled from 1 to 2 (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective), and Post-Napoleonic doubled from 1 to 2 (Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective), all moving from Singular to Minor Presence.
- Three new categories appeared in the 176-200 expansion: World War II (Undaunted: Normandy), Pirates (The Isle of Cats), and Prehistoric (Stone Age). The total unique category count rose from 63 to 66. The singular tier now contains 18 categories, roughly 27% of all unique categories, continuing the downward trend from 36% at 125 games, 33% at 150 games, and 30% at 175 games.
