### Theme Integration

7 Wonders places each player at the helm of one of seven great cities of the
ancient world — Rhodes, Alexandria, Ephesus, Babylon, Olympia, Halicarnassus,
and Giza — tasked with developing their civilization across three ages. The
seven card colors map directly to the pillars of ancient society: brown cards
are raw materials (lumber, stone, clay, ore), gray cards are manufactured goods
(glass, loom, papyrus), blue cards are civilian structures (temples, baths,
palaces), green cards are scientific institutions (workshops, laboratories,
universities), yellow cards are commercial structures (markets, trading posts,
caravanseries), red cards are military fortifications (stockades, barracks,
arsenals), and purple Guild cards in Age III reflect the specialized expertise
that emerges in mature civilizations.

Each Wonder board produces a starting resource and offers two or three
construction stages with escalating costs and rewards, grounding each city in
its historical identity. The Colossus of Rhodes adds military strength; the
Lighthouse of Alexandria generates flexible resources; the Hanging Gardens of
Babylon reward scientific achievement. The three-age structure mirrors the
rise of civilizations from resource gathering (Age I) through infrastructure
development (Age II) to cultural and military apex (Age III). Commerce between
neighboring cities — purchasing resources from the players sitting directly
to your left and right — creates a sense of geographic proximity and trade
relationships that reinforces the ancient Mediterranean setting without
requiring a physical map.

### Core Loop

The game spans three Ages, each consisting of six turns played simultaneously
by all players. Each turn follows three phases:

1. CHOOSE A CARD - Each player selects one card from their hand and places it
   face down. The selection is simultaneous and secret. The remaining hand is
   passed to the neighboring player (left in Ages I and III, right in Age II).

2. PERFORM AN ACTION - All players reveal their chosen cards simultaneously
   and perform one of three actions:
   a. BUILD THE STRUCTURE - Pay the resource cost shown on the card (using
      resources from your own city, purchased from neighbors at 2 coins each,
      or obtained free through construction chains from previous ages). Place
      the card in your city tableau. Brown and gray cards tuck beneath the
      Wonder board for resource tracking; all others are placed face-up.
   b. BUILD A WONDER STAGE - Use the chosen card (face down) as a construction
      marker for the next stage of your Wonder. Pay the Wonder stage's resource
      cost, not the card's. Stages must be built left to right.
   c. DISCARD FOR COINS - Discard the card face-down to the center and receive
      3 coins from the bank.

3. PASS HANDS - Each player takes the hand of cards passed by their neighbor.
   The direction alternates each Age. On the sixth and final turn of each Age,
   players receive a 2-card hand: they play one card and discard the other.

After each Age, resolve MILITARY CONFLICTS: each player compares their total
shield count (from red cards and Wonders) with each of their two neighbors.
Higher total wins a Victory token (Age I: +1, Age II: +3, Age III: +5);
lower total takes a Defeat token (-1). Ties award nothing.

After Age III, count victory points across seven categories: Military Conflicts,
Treasury (1 VP per 3 coins), Wonders, Civilian Structures, Scientific Structures
(squared sets of identical symbols plus 7 VP per set of three different symbols),
Commercial Structures, and Guilds. Highest total wins.

### Key Design Patterns

SIMULTANEOUS CARD DRAFTING: 7 Wonders' signature innovation is applying the
card-drafting mechanism — familiar from collectible card games — to a
civilization-building framework where all players act simultaneously. This
eliminates downtime entirely: a 7-player game takes the same 30 minutes as a
3-player game because every player chooses and acts at the same time. The
drafting creates shared information flow — the cards you pass reveal your
priorities, and the cards you receive constrain your future options. Each hand
circulates through multiple players, creating a web of indirect interaction
where your card choice simultaneously builds your civilization and shapes what
your neighbors and their neighbors can build. The alternating pass direction
between ages prevents any single neighbor relationship from dominating.

NEIGHBOR-ONLY INTERACTION: In 7 Wonders, you interact meaningfully only with
the players directly to your left and right. Military conflicts compare your
shields with each neighbor. Commerce allows purchasing resources from neighbors
at 2 coins each. Guild cards in Age III score based on your and your neighbors'
tableaus. This neighbor-only scope dramatically reduces the information load in
higher player counts — in a 7-player game, you primarily need to track 2 other
players rather than 6. It creates distinct local metagames at each table
position while maintaining global balance through the drafting circulation.
Bauza's design insight was that limiting interaction scope was the key to
making a civilization game scale to 7 players without collapsing under
combinatorial complexity.

CONSTRUCTION CHAINS AS TEMPORAL REWARDS: Many structures in Ages II and III
can be built for free if the player constructed a specific predecessor in a
previous Age. The Scriptorium (Age I) unlocks free construction of the Library
and Courthouse (Age II); the Theater leads to the Statue, which leads to the
Gardens. These chains reward long-term planning across ages and create an
alternative economy where earlier investments pay dividends through resource
savings later. They also introduce a timing pressure: a chain-enabling card
in Age I may seem modest on its own but represents substantial future value.
The chain system encourages strategic drafting rather than purely tactical
turn-by-turn optimization.

MULTI-USE CARDS: Every card in hand serves three possible purposes: build the
structure for its printed effect, tuck it under your Wonder as a construction
stage (ignoring the card's printed content), or discard it for 3 coins. This
triple-use design ensures that no card is ever truly dead — even a military
card in a peaceful strategy can fuel Wonder construction. The multi-use
property also adds depth to the draft: you must evaluate each card not only
for its own value but for what it could do as Wonder fuel, and for whether
discarding it for coins might be optimal. Hate-drafting (taking a card to
deny it to a neighbor) carries a real cost because the drafted card must still
be used for one of the three purposes.

SCIENCE AS EXPONENTIAL SCORING: The three scientific symbols (Gear, Compass,
Tablet) score via two cumulative formulas: identical symbols score as the count
squared (1, 4, 9, 16 for 1-4 copies), and each complete set of three different
symbols scores 7 points. A player with 3 Gears, 2 Compasses, and 1 Tablet
scores 9 + 4 + 1 + 7 = 21 points. This exponential scaling makes science the
highest-ceiling strategy but also the most vulnerable to disruption, since
opponents can hate-draft key science cards passing through them. The scoring
formula creates a "go big or go home" dynamic: partial science investment yields
poor returns, while committed science play can dominate the scoreboard.

VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS VIA WONDER BOARDS: Each Wonder board provides a unique
starting resource, a different number and configuration of Wonder stages (2-4
stages with varied costs and rewards), and optional A/B sides of differing
complexity. Rhodes emphasizes military; Babylon rewards science; Olympia grants
free building; Giza offers raw victory points. These asymmetric starting
positions push players toward different strategies without locking them in,
as the drafting system provides flexibility to pivot. The B sides add strategic
depth for experienced players, offering more complex stage effects and
different progression paths. The Wonder boards transform what could be a
purely symmetric card game into one where each player begins with a distinct
strategic identity.

PLAYER COUNT SCALING VIA CARD REMOVAL: Rather than changing fundamental rules,
7 Wonders scales from 3 to 7 players by adjusting which cards appear in each
Age deck. Cards are marked with minimum player count icons (3+, 4+, 5+, 6+,
7+), and only those matching the current player count are included. This
ensures that resource availability, military frequency, and strategic diversity
remain proportional regardless of table size. The number of Guilds in Age III
also scales (number of players plus 2, randomly selected), maintaining endgame
variety without flooding the deck. The 2-player variant uses a separate "Free
City" mechanism to simulate the neighbor dynamic.

MILITARY AS INCREMENTAL PRESSURE: Military strength in 7 Wonders is not about
conquest but about relative positioning. You only compare shields with your two
neighbors at the end of each age, and the rewards escalate (+1, +3, +5 across
ages) while defeats always cost -1. This incremental structure means that early
military investment (cheap Age I red cards) provides modest returns but
establishes a foundation for escalating Age III rewards. The -1 Defeat tokens
create floor-level military pressure — completely ignoring military guarantees
losing 6 points across three ages against two neighbors — while the ceiling
(+18 from winning all six comparisons) rewards committed military play without
making it mandatory.

### What Makes It #114

7 Wonders proved that a civilization game could accommodate seven players in
thirty minutes without sacrificing strategic depth. Bauza's simultaneous
drafting mechanism solved the fundamental tension between player count and
game length that plagued the genre, creating a design template that has
influenced hundreds of subsequent games. The neighbor-only interaction scope,
the multi-use card design, and the construction chain system create interlocking
layers of decision-making that reward repeated play while remaining accessible
to new players. At 2.31 weight, it sits precisely at the gateway between
casual and strategic gaming, offering enough depth to sustain experienced
players while teaching new ones the fundamentals of engine building, resource
management, and drafting. Its influence on modern game design — from card
drafting as a primary mechanism to simultaneous action selection as a scaling
solution — is difficult to overstate.
