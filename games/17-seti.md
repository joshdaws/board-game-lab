## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

SETI translates the real-world search for extraterrestrial intelligence into a
euro-style engine builder where scientific authenticity drives design decisions. The
200+ unique cards depict actual or plausible technologies — the International Space
Station, Large Hadron Collider, Voyager probe, James Webb Space Telescope — each
with custom illustrations and mechanically relevant effects. Players lead competing
scientific institutions deploying probes, operating telescopes, and analyzing data,
mirroring the three primary methods of real space exploration. The rotating solar
system board physically represents planetary orbits: inner planets (Mercury, Venus,
Earth, Mars) rotate more frequently than outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune), creating the positional uncertainty that actual mission planners face
when targeting launch windows. Probes must travel through space spending energy,
land on planets and moons to collect samples, or orbit to gather remote data —
each reflecting genuine mission profiles. The alien discovery system layers
speculative science atop real methodology: you don't find aliens directly, you
collect three types of traces (signals from telescopes, samples from landings,
processed data from analysis) that together reveal a species. The game celebrates
the process of scientific discovery rather than its outcome.

### Core Loop

The game lasts exactly five rounds. Within each round, players take turns performing
one main action until all players have passed:

1. CHOOSE MAIN ACTION - Select one of eight possible actions:
   a) PLAY A CARD - Pay credits to activate a card's main effect, or play it
      as a mission (placed in front of you, triggers when conditions are met).
   b) LAUNCH PROBE - Pay credits to deploy a new probe from Earth onto the
      solar system board.
   c) ORBIT PROBE - Move a probe into orbit around a planet, paying credits
      and energy. Earn rewards: data cubes, radio signals, or increased income.
   d) LAND PROBE - Land a probe on a planet or moon surface, paying energy.
      Collect yellow traces of alien life. Probe technology upgrades unlock
      moon landings.
   e) SCAN NEARBY STARS - Use telescopes on your player board to scan
      extrasolar sectors. Discard cards matching target sectors, apply telescope
      upgrades. Discover pink traces (signals). Area majority in sectors
      determines signal rewards.
   f) ANALYZE DATA - Process accumulated data cubes on your computer track
      to discover blue traces. Requires filling computer slots first.
   g) RESEARCH TECHNOLOGY - Pay publicity to upgrade one of three tech tracks
      (probes, telescopes, computers). Also rotates the solar system board.
   h) PASS - Discard down to four cards, optionally rotate the solar system
      if you're the first to pass. Select an end-of-round bonus card.

2. FREE ACTIONS (before or after main action, unlimited):
   - Place data cubes on player board
   - Complete triggered mission cards
   - Discard a card for its free-action benefit (top-left corner effect)
   - Spend energy to move probes through space
   - Pay 3 publicity to purchase a card
   - Exchange resources at 2:1 ratio

3. ROUND END (after all pass) - All players gain income from base rates
   (3 credits, 2 energy, 1 card) plus bonuses from tucked income cards.

Victory: After five rounds, final scoring tallies card effects with end-game
bonuses, gold milestone tiles collected during play, and points from discovered
alien species. Highest total wins.

### Key Design Patterns

ROTATING SOLAR SYSTEM AS DYNAMIC RONDEL: The central board's rotating rings are
SETI's signature mechanism. Planets sit on concentric tracks that rotate at
different speeds — inner planets move more frequently than outer ones, mimicking
actual orbital mechanics. Rotation is triggered by two player actions: researching
technology (a deliberate choice) and being the first player to pass each round
(a strategic sacrifice). When the system rotates, probes on the board move with
their ring, planets shift positions relative to each other, and carefully planned
trajectories can be disrupted or enhanced. This transforms the board from a static
map into a living system where timing matters as much as position. A probe launched
toward Jupiter this round might find Jupiter has rotated away by the time it
arrives — unless you control the rotation timing. The positional uncertainty
scales with player count: more players mean more rotation triggers and less
predictable outcomes.

MULTI-USE CARDS AS DECISION COMPRESSION: Each of SETI's 138 unique cards serves
four distinct functions: a free-action benefit (discard for an immediate small
effect), a main action (pay credits for a powerful effect), a mission (place in
front of you for a conditional trigger), and an income tuck (slide under your
player board for permanent per-round income). Every card drawn forces a four-way
decision about its optimal use, and that optimality shifts based on game state.
A card might be worth tucking for income in round 1 but more valuable as a
free-action discard in round 4. Cards also serve as fuel for telescope scanning
(discarded to match sectors) and probe movement (discarded instead of spending
energy). This multi-use architecture means hand management is never about having
"good" or "bad" cards — every card has value, and the skill lies in finding the
highest-value use at each moment.

THREE-TRACE ALIEN DISCOVERY: Discovering alien life requires collecting three
different trace types, each earned through a different game system: pink traces
from scanning distant stars with telescopes, yellow traces from landing probes
on planetary surfaces, and blue traces from analyzing accumulated data on your
computer track. Each trace type demands investment in different technology tracks
and different board actions. Traces are placed beneath the alien species board
until all three types are collected, at which point the species is "discovered"
and its board flips, revealing unique cards, tokens, and rule modifications that
alter the remaining game. The three-trace requirement forces players to diversify
their approach — a pure probe strategy or pure telescope strategy can't discover
aliens alone. The five included alien species create variable game-to-game
discovery experiences.

TECHNOLOGY TRACKS AS BRANCHING ENGINE: Three upgrade paths on the player board
govern your capabilities in probes, telescopes, and computers. Probe technology
increases your maximum probe count and unlocks moon landings (accessing more
valuable trace sites). Telescope technology enhances scanning actions, letting
you mark extra signals per scan and access more sectors. Computer technology
adds data processing slots and bonus points, with the requirement that you must
fill your current computer track completely before analyzing data for blue traces.
Each upgrade costs publicity (one of three currencies) and triggers a solar system
rotation, connecting your engine-building to the dynamic board state. The three
tracks create strategic identity — heavy probe investment makes you an explorer,
heavy telescope investment makes you a surveyor, heavy computer investment makes
you an analyst — but alien discovery demands at least some presence in all three.

INCOME TUCKING AS TEMPORAL INVESTMENT: When you tuck a card under your player
board for income, you gain its immediate benefit (printed resources) AND its
per-round income bonus for every subsequent round. A card tucked in round 1
pays off four more times; a card tucked in round 4 pays off once. This creates
a declining-return investment curve that rewards early income infrastructure.
But tucking a card means forfeiting its other three uses (main action, mission,
free action). The tension between immediate power and long-term income generation
is sharpest in the early rounds, when cards are scarce and every one feels too
valuable to commit to a permanent role. The income system also softens the
starting resource asymmetry — players who invest early in income can sustain
more expensive actions later without falling behind.

PASS-FIRST AS STRATEGIC SACRIFICE: The first player to pass each round gains
two exclusive benefits: they get to rotate the solar system (disrupting or
enabling other players' plans) and they choose first from the end-of-round bonus
cards. But passing means taking no more main actions for the round — every action
your opponents take after you pass is tempo they gain. This creates a game of
chicken: passing early gives you control over the board state but surrenders
action economy. In competitive situations, the rotation control can be decisive —
rotating a planet away from an opponent's probe or toward your own can swing
an entire round. The pass-first mechanism ensures that even the act of stopping
play is a meaningful strategic decision.

RESOURCE SCARCITY AND COMBO CHAINS: Three currencies — credits (for launching
and playing cards), energy (for probe movement and orbital insertion), and
publicity (for technology upgrades and card purchases) — are each tight enough
that no single resource feels abundant. Base income provides 3 credits, 2 energy,
and 1 card per round, with publicity earned through specific actions. The scarcity
forces players to chain effects efficiently: landing a probe might complete a
mission that grants credits, enabling a card play that generates energy, enabling
probe movement to a new planet. These combo moments — where one action cascades
into several — are the game's most satisfying beats, and they emerge from the
multi-use card system interacting with tight resource constraints.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1 player: Solo mode against an automated opponent. The core systems remain
  intact but area majority scoring is handled differently.
- 2 players: Tightest competition for sector majority and milestone tiles. Solar
  system rotation is most predictable (fewer triggers).
- 3-4 players: More rotation triggers create greater positional uncertainty.
  Area majority in telescope sectors becomes more contested. Card availability
  per player decreases, increasing drafting pressure.
- Play time scales from 40 minutes (experienced 2-player) to 160 minutes (learning
  4-player), reflecting the variable turns-per-round structure.

### What Makes It #17

SETI's rotating solar system board is unlike anything else on this list — a
physical rondel that mimics actual orbital mechanics, making the game board itself
a dynamic system that players influence but never fully control. The multi-use card
system compresses extraordinary decision density into every draw, ensuring no card
is dead weight. The three-trace alien discovery system elegantly forces strategic
diversification without prescribing a specific path. And the pass-first mechanism
transforms the act of stopping into a strategic weapon. At 3.82 weight, SETI is
more accessible than most games in the top 25, but its interlocking systems —
rotating board, multi-use cards, three tech tracks, three resource types, and
combo-driven action economy — create a depth that rewards repeated play. The
scientific theme isn't decorative; it shapes every mechanism, from orbital
mechanics to data analysis to the patient, methodical work of searching for
life among the stars.
