## Design Notes

Designer: Uwe Rosenberg. Published by Z-Man Games (2014).

### Theme Integration

Fields of Arle is set in the East Frisian village of Arle, a real place in
northwestern Germany where Rosenberg's family has roots. This is not
incidental — the game is a love letter to a specific landscape and way of
life. East Frisia is defined by its relationship to water: the land is flat,
boggy, and must be reclaimed from marshes through diking and drainage. The
economy historically depended on peat cutting for fuel, textile production
from flax and sheep, and trade via coastal shipping routes. Every one of
these activities appears as a mechanical system in the game. Fields of Arle
is not a farming game with a regional skin; it is a simulation of a
particular agrarian-industrial economy, and the specificity of its setting
gives the design its character.

The agricultural systems model the full lifecycle of East Frisian farming.
You plow fields, sow grain or flax, harvest crops, and raise animals —
horses, cattle, and sheep — that breed at the end of each winter. Sheep
produce wool. Cattle provide hides. Flax becomes linen. These raw materials
feed into textile production chains that are the game's economic backbone.
Rosenberg does not simplify these chains for convenience; he models them
with the specificity of someone who has studied how rural German communities
actually functioned. The result is a game that teaches you something about
its setting as you play it: you understand why East Frisians cut peat
(because wood was scarce on the boggy flatlands), why textile production
was central (because the raw materials — flax and wool — were locally
abundant), and why trade required investment in vehicles (because the
coastal geography demanded boats and carts for market access).

The seasonal structure reinforces the agrarian theme. The game alternates
between summer and winter half-years, each with different available actions.
Summer actions emphasize outdoor work: building dikes, cutting peat, plowing
fields, shearing sheep. Winter actions emphasize indoor and craft work:
weaving textiles, tanning hides, building structures. This is not arbitrary
flavor — it reflects the genuine seasonal rhythms of pre-industrial farming
life, where the type of labor available depended on weather and daylight.
The seasonal distinction shapes strategy because it forces players to plan
across half-years: you cannot weave linen in summer or cut peat with the
Peat Boatman in summer.

### Core Loop

The game plays over 9 half-years (alternating summer and winter), with each
half-year constituting a worker-placement round. Two players share a central
action board; solo play uses a modified version.

**Each Half-Year:**

1. WORKER PLACEMENT: Players alternate placing workers (4 each) on action
   spaces. Summer and winter offer different action sets, though some
   spaces are available year-round.

   Summer-specific actions include:
   - FARMER — Build a plow and/or plow fields to display grain or flax.
   - BUILD DIKE — Place a dike tile to reclaim land from the marsh,
     expanding your usable territory.
   - CUT PEAT — Remove peat tokens from moor spaces for fuel.
   - WOOLEN WEAVER — Convert wool to woolen cloth.
   - COLONIST — Take a horse and/or dehydrate a moor section.
   - WOODCUTTER — Collect wood based on your axes.

   Winter-specific actions include:
   - LINEN WEAVER — Convert flax to linen.
   - TANNER — Convert hides to leather.
   - BUTCHER — Slaughter animals for food and hides.
   - POTTER — Convert clay to food and peat.
   - WAINWRIGHT — Build a vehicle and/or a peat boat.

   Year-round actions (present in both summer and winter) include:
   - MASTER — Upgrade tool indicators on the game board.
   - CARPENTER — Build a stall or upgrade stalls to stables.
   - LABORER — Pay food to build, or imitate an occupied action space.
   - WARDEN/DIKE WARDEN — Flip upgrade tiles for free.

2. BREEDING: At the end of each winter half-year (May Inventorying),
   animals breed. Stalls with exactly 2 animals of the same type produce
   one offspring; stables with 2, 3, or 5 animals also produce one.
   Stables with exactly 4 animals produce two offspring. Animals need
   accommodation (dikes, empty land spaces, stalls, stables, or parks)
   or they must be returned to the supply.

3. SUSTENANCE: At the end of each half-year, players must pay food (3 Food
   in both seasons) and, in November only, fuel (2 Peat). Missing items
   can be substituted (grain for food, wood for peat) or cost 2 VP each.

4. INCOME: Receive income based on buildings, trade routes, and other
   economic infrastructure.

**End Game**: After 9 half-years, score victory points from buildings,
developed land, animals, goods, trade routes, and remaining resources.
Scoring is broad — almost everything contributes — rewarding diverse
development over narrow specialization.

### Key Design Patterns

TWO-PLAYER INTIMACY BY DESIGN: Fields of Arle is built for one or two
players, not scaled down from a larger count. This distinction matters
enormously. In a 2-player worker placement game, every action your opponent
takes is one you cannot take. There is no diffusion of blocking across
multiple rivals; the interaction is direct and personal. Rosenberg calibrated
the number of action spaces, the resource economy, and the pacing for this
tight dyadic experience. The result is a game that feels intimate rather
than competitive — you are two neighboring farmers managing adjacent plots,
occasionally competing for the same market stall or trade route but mostly
pursuing parallel development. The 2-player constraint allowed Rosenberg to
include far more action spaces than a 4-player game could support, creating
the sandbox breadth that defines the experience.

SEASONAL WORKER PLACEMENT: The alternation between summer and winter action
sets is the game's structural signature. Rather than offering the same menu
of options every round, Fields of Arle forces players to think in seasonal
rhythms. You must use the Woolen Weaver in summer to convert wool before winter.
You must plow fields in summer via the Farmer to harvest grain and flax. This temporal
dependency creates planning horizons longer than a single round: you are
always preparing for the next season's opportunities. The seasonal structure
also prevents the common worker-placement problem of "always do the same
thing" — because the available actions rotate, you must adapt your plans
to the current season's possibilities, even if your long-term strategy
remains consistent.

TEXTILE PRODUCTION CHAIN AS INDUSTRIAL ENGINE: The textile system is the
game's most sophisticated economic model. Raw materials (flax from fields,
wool from sheep, hides from cattle) undergo multiple transformations: flax
becomes linen, wool becomes woolen cloth, hides become leather. Each
transformation requires a specific action (weave, tan) and may require
upgraded tools. The finished textiles are significantly more valuable than
raw materials, both for trade and for end-game scoring. This production
chain rewards vertical integration — players who control the full supply
chain from raw material to finished good are more efficient than those who
trade at intermediate stages. The textile system is also the primary bridge
between the agricultural and economic halves of the game: farming produces
the inputs that industry refines into value.

DIKE BUILDING AS LAND RECLAMATION: Your personal board starts as a mix of
usable land and unusable marsh. Building dikes — a specific action requiring
resources — converts marsh into dry land, expanding your territory. This is
not cosmetic; new land provides space for buildings, fields, and animal
pasture. The dike-building system creates a spatial development arc: early
in the game your options are constrained by limited land, and mid-to-late
game your expanded territory supports more ambitious projects. The mechanic
is also historically grounded — East Frisian communities literally built
dikes to reclaim land from the North Sea — and it gives the game a physical
sense of progress as your board transforms from waterlogged bog to
productive farmland.

VEHICLE UPGRADING FOR TRADE CAPACITY: Trade in Fields of Arle requires
vehicles — handcarts, wagons, carts, horse carts, carriages, and droshkies.
Each vehicle type has different cargo capacity (single and double spaces)
and costs. Upgrading from smaller vehicles (handcarts, wagons) to larger
ones (horse carts, carriages, droshkies) increases your cargo capacity and
opens more valuable trade destinations. The vehicle system creates an economic infrastructure layer: you
cannot simply produce goods and sell them; you must invest in the logistics
to bring them to market. This models the real economic reality of rural
production — the gap between creating value and capturing value is bridged
by transportation — and it creates a satisfying investment arc as your
trade capabilities grow.

BUILDING DIVERSITY AS STRATEGIC BRANCHING: The game offers a large catalog
of buildings, each with unique abilities, resource costs, and scoring
potential. A bakery converts grain to food efficiently. A carpenter's
workshop provides building discounts. A warehouse stores excess goods. No
single building is dominant; each supports a different strategic emphasis.
The building catalog is deliberately oversized relative to what any single
player can construct in 9 half-years, which means every game requires
choosing a subset of buildings that synergize with your chosen strategy.
This catalog-too-large-for-one-game pattern is a Rosenberg signature
(seen also in Caverna and A Feast for Odin) and is the primary mechanism
for ensuring replayability in sandbox designs.

PEAT CUTTING AS FUEL ECONOMY: Peat — blocks of compressed organic material
cut from boggy ground — serves as the game's fuel resource. It is needed
for heating (essential in winter), for certain production actions, and as
a trade good. Peat must be cut from moor spaces on your board, which
means harvesting peat competes with plowing those same spaces for farmland.
This creates a genuine resource dilemma: moor land is more immediately
productive when cut for peat, but plowed fields provide long-term
agricultural value. The peat system grounds the game in its specific
geography — peat cutting was the defining industry of East Frisian moor
settlements — while also creating a meaningful strategic tradeoff between
short-term fuel needs and long-term land development.

THE GENEROUS SANDBOX: Compared to Rosenberg's more famous Agricola, Fields
of Arle is strikingly lenient. Feeding requirements are manageable. The
penalty for missing sustenance (2 VP per missing item) is mild compared
to games like Agricola. The scoring system
rewards breadth, giving points for almost everything you accumulate. The
action space menu is vast relative to the number of workers, so blocking
is rarely crippling. This generosity is a deliberate design choice, not a
failure of tension. Rosenberg designed Arle as an exploration game — the
pleasure comes from discovering synergies across the textile, agricultural,
and trade systems, not from surviving a punishing economy. The sandbox
approach trusts players to find their own goals rather than imposing a
single optimization target, and it makes the game deeply replayable
because there are always strategies left unexplored.

### What Makes It #99

Fields of Arle represents a mature Rosenberg — a designer who had already
proven he could create punishing survival economies (Agricola) and chose
instead to build something generous and exploratory. The game's strength
is its breadth: the textile production chains, the seasonal rhythms, the
dike reclamation, the vehicle trade system, and the sprawling building
catalog create a sandbox with genuine depth but minimal anxiety. The
two-player focus gives it an intimacy rare in the worker-placement genre,
and the East Frisian setting provides thematic specificity that
distinguishes it from generic farming games. Fields of Arle is what
happens when a designer knows a place well enough to make a game about
how it actually worked, and trusts players enough to let them explore it
at their own pace.
