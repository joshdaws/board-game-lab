## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Harmonies presents itself as a landscape-building game where players stack colored
tokens to create terrain formations that attract wildlife, and the theme is doing
more mechanical work than its abstract-leaning appearance suggests. The six token
colors map to terrain types: green for trees, yellow for fields, blue for water,
grey for mountains, brown for tree trunks and building foundations, and red for
building rooftops. The animal habitat cards that define scoring
objectives depict specific three-dimensional terrain configurations that, viewed
from above or the side, resemble the natural environments each animal would inhabit.
A mountain goat card might require a pyramidal stack of grey tokens; a frog card
might demand a flat expanse of blue. The theme is not narrative, but it is
structurally coherent: the spatial patterns you build look like the habitats they
represent.

This visual-thematic coherence serves a critical accessibility function. Players do
not need to memorize abstract scoring conditions; they can look at an animal card,
see its habitat shape, and intuitively understand what three-dimensional formation
they are trying to construct. The theme transforms what could be an opaque spatial
logic puzzle into a comprehensible landscape-building exercise. Libellud, known for
the visual extravagance of Dixit and Mysterium, brings that same attention to
aesthetic experience here. The game is beautiful to look at during and after play,
and that beauty is inseparable from its mechanical clarity.

The harmony between form and function extends to the game's emotional register. There
is no conflict in Harmonies, no destruction, no competition for territory. Players
build landscapes in parallel, occasionally competing for tokens in the shared display
but never interfering with each other's constructions. The nature theme reinforces
this peaceful tenor. Building a landscape for animals to inhabit feels collaborative
with the game itself, as though you and the system are working together to create
something beautiful. This emotional quality is not accidental; it is a design choice
that defines the game's audience and play experience.

### Core Loop

Harmonies unfolds through a simple draft-and-build loop that generates emergent
complexity through three-dimensional spatial constraints:

1. DRAFT TOKENS - On your turn, select one group of three tokens from the shared
   display. Token groups are arranged in a central grid, and each group contains a
   specific combination of terrain colors determined by a drawn pattern card. The
   display offers multiple groups, and selection is the primary point of interaction
   with other players: taking a group removes it from availability.

2. PLACE TOKENS - Place the three drafted tokens onto your personal landscape board,
   a hexagonal grid where tokens can be placed flat or stacked on top of existing
   tokens. Placement rules require adjacency to existing tokens (or placement in the
   starting zone on the first turn). Stacking is the game's defining spatial mechanic:
   tokens placed on higher levels require supported positions, and the resulting
   three-dimensional structure is the puzzle you are solving.

3. CHECK ANIMAL CARDS - After placing, check whether any of your animal habitat
   cards have been completed. Each card depicts a specific three-dimensional pattern
   of colored tokens that must exist somewhere in your landscape. Completed cards
   are scored immediately and the animal token is placed on the matching formation
   as a visual marker. Multiple cards may share overlapping tokens, creating
   opportunities for efficient spatial planning.

4. REFILL DISPLAY - Draw new tokens from the bag to refill the central display,
   creating new groups for future drafting. The random draw ensures that the
   available combinations shift each round, requiring adaptive planning.

5. GAME END - The game ends when the token pouch is exhausted or a player's board
   has two or fewer unoccupied spaces. Final scoring tallies landscape points (for
   trees, mountains, fields, water, and buildings) plus animal card points. Each
   animal card scores based on how many cubes have been placed on it: partially
   completed cards score reduced points rather than nothing, but cards with no cubes
   placed score zero. This graduated scoring creates a tension between ambitious card
   selection and reliable completion.

### Key Design Patterns

THREE-DIMENSIONAL SPATIAL PUZZLE: Harmonies' defining innovation is the use of
vertical stacking as a core mechanical dimension. Most tile-placement games operate
on a two-dimensional plane; Harmonies adds a third axis that fundamentally changes
the nature of spatial reasoning. A token placed on the ground level has different
strategic implications than one placed on the second or third level, because height
creates structural dependencies: higher tokens require lower tokens to support them,
and the color of support tokens matters for scoring. This vertical dimension
transforms simple pattern matching into a genuine architectural challenge, where
players must think about foundation structures that will support future scoring
patterns.

ANIMAL CARDS AS VARIABLE OBJECTIVES: Each game of Harmonies uses a different
combination of animal habitat cards, and these cards define entirely different
spatial challenges. A game focused on burrowing animals requires horizontal patterns
at ground level; a game featuring mountain species demands tall pyramidal stacks; a
game with aquatic animals needs broad, flat expanses. The variability in objectives
means that optimal landscape architecture changes from game to game, preventing
the development of a single dominant strategy. The animal cards also interact with
each other: selecting cards with compatible spatial requirements allows efficient
overlap, while incompatible cards force difficult trade-offs in landscape planning.

DRAFTING FROM SHARED DISPLAY: The token display is the game's primary interaction
mechanism. Groups of three tokens are visible to all players, and selecting a group
removes it from the pool. This creates a reading challenge: you must evaluate not
only which group best serves your landscape but also which groups your opponents
need. The grouping of tokens into threes means that drafting is never a pure
optimization; you always get three tokens, and often one or two of them are
suboptimal for your current needs. This forced bundling generates interesting
secondary decisions about where to place unwanted tokens without disrupting your
landscape plan.

VERTICAL STACKING AS EMERGENT COMPLEXITY: The stacking rule is simple, tokens can
be placed on top of supported positions, but its consequences are complex. Early in
the game, the landscape is flat and placement decisions feel straightforward. As the
game progresses and the landscape grows vertically, new spatial relationships emerge.
A ground-level token that seemed inconsequential becomes a critical foundation for a
third-level scoring pattern. The complexity curve is organic: the rules do not change,
but the decision space deepens as the physical structure grows. This emergent
complexity is the hallmark of elegant game design, where simple rules generate deep
play through accumulation rather than addition.

VISUAL-TACTILE ACCESSIBILITY: Harmonies is designed to be understood through
looking and touching rather than reading and calculating. The animal cards show
visual diagrams of the required token patterns. The tokens themselves are solid,
satisfying objects that create a visible, tangible landscape. Scoring conditions
are communicated spatially rather than textually. This visual-tactile design
philosophy lowers the barrier to entry dramatically: players who struggle with
text-heavy rule sets or numerical optimization can engage with Harmonies through
spatial intuition. The game proves that mechanical depth and perceptual accessibility
are not mutually exclusive.

OVERLAP EFFICIENCY AS STRATEGIC AXIS: The most rewarding plays in Harmonies involve
arranging tokens so that a single section of landscape satisfies multiple animal
cards simultaneously. A well-planned stack of blue-over-grey tokens might complete
both a fish card and a mountain stream card at the same time. This overlap efficiency
is the game's primary skill expression: novice players build each animal's habitat
separately, while expert players architect shared foundations that serve multiple
objectives. The design rewards spatial foresight without punishing players who
take a simpler approach.

PEACEFUL COMPETITION: Harmonies occupies a specific design niche: competitive in
structure but peaceful in experience. Players compete for score, but the competition
is mediated entirely through the shared display. There is no territory to invade,
no resources to steal, no plans to sabotage. The only way to affect opponents is
by taking tokens they wanted, and even this is softened by the display's randomized
refill. This peaceful competition model expands the game's audience to include
players who enjoy optimization but dislike confrontation, a significant and
underserved demographic in hobby gaming.

TOKEN BAG AS PACING MECHANISM: The finite token bag serves as the game's clock,
and its depletion creates natural pacing. Early rounds feel expansive, with abundant
tokens and open landscapes. Late rounds feel constrained, with limited tokens and
the pressure to complete animal cards before the bag empties. This mechanical arc
mirrors a satisfying narrative shape: exploration, development, culmination. The
bag also introduces controlled randomness: you know the total distribution of
token colors, but not the order they will appear, creating a planning-under-
uncertainty dynamic that rewards adaptability.

### What Makes It #59

Harmonies' achievement is making three-dimensional spatial reasoning feel intuitive
and inviting rather than intimidating. The vertical stacking mechanic adds genuine
strategic depth to the pattern-building genre, but the visual-tactile design
language ensures that this depth is accessible to players at the 1.88 weight level.
The animal card variability prevents strategic stagnation, the drafting mechanism
provides clean interaction without conflict, and the overlap efficiency system
rewards spatial creativity in ways that feel discovered rather than calculated.
Benvenuto and Libellud have created a game that is simultaneously a family-friendly
landscape builder and a deep spatial optimization puzzle, and the fact that both
audiences can play the same game with the same rules is a testament to the power
of emergent complexity through simple physical systems.
