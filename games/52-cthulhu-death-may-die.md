## Design Notes

Designer: Rob Daviau & Eric M. Lang. Published by CMON (2019).

### Theme Integration

Cthulhu: Death May Die inverts the most fundamental assumption of Lovecraftian
gaming: that encountering an Elder God means you have already lost. In most
Cthulhu-themed games, the investigators' goal is to prevent the summoning, seal
the gate, or delay the inevitable. Here, the cultists have already succeeded. The
ritual is underway. The investigators' plan is not to stop it but to disrupt it
just enough to weaken the Elder God so that it can be fought and killed. This
premise — deliberately confronting cosmic horror rather than fleeing from it —
gives the game a momentum and aggression absent from most cooperative horror
designs. The investigators are not victims or scholars; they are desperate fighters
who have accepted that madness is the price of victory.

The insanity system is the game's most thematically resonant mechanic. As
investigators suffer stress and encounter the unknowable, they advance along an
insanity track that grants them increasingly powerful abilities — but also brings
them closer to death. An investigator who has glimpsed the truth behind reality
can channel that knowledge into supernatural focus, rerolling dice or dealing
extra damage. But push too far and the mind shatters entirely, removing the
investigator from the game. This is not insanity as a penalty; it is insanity as
a resource that must be spent wisely. The design captures a distinctly Lovecraftian
idea — that forbidden knowledge grants power at a terrible personal cost — and
translates it into a mechanical risk-reward curve that players must navigate every
turn.

The miniatures themselves serve a design function beyond spectacle. The Elder Gods
are physically imposing figures that dominate the table, and their presence creates
a spatial reality that cardboard tokens cannot replicate. When Cthulhu towers over
your investigator's miniature, the scale differential communicates the absurdity
of your task more effectively than any flavor text. The monster miniatures also
create clear board-state legibility: players can instantly assess threat density
in a room by the cluster of figures present, enabling faster tactical decisions
in a game where analysis paralysis would undermine the intended pace.

### Core Loop

Each investigator's turn follows a structured action-point sequence:

1. RECEIVE ACTION POINTS - Each investigator begins their turn with 3 action
   points (some abilities or conditions may modify this).
2. SPEND ACTIONS - Each action point may be spent on one of the following:
   a) MOVE - Move to an adjacent room on the modular board.
   b) ATTACK - Target a single enemy in your space and make a roll. Each success
      deals one wound to the target; tentacle results cost 1 sanity each.
   c) REST - Only available in a Safe space (no enemies present). Heal your
      stress and/or wounds up to 3 spaces total across those tracks.
   d) TRADE - Exchange items or companions with another investigator in the
      same room.
   e) EPISODE-SPECIFIC ACTIONS - Each scenario defines unique actions related
      to disrupting the ritual (e.g., destroying ritual components, activating
      seals, gathering clues).
3. DRAW MYTHOS CARD - Draw and resolve one Mythos card from the deck. Mythos
   cards may advance the Elder One's summoning track, spawn monsters, move
   enemies, or trigger special effects. The Mythos deck is the game's clock —
   it advances relentlessly regardless of player success.
4. INVESTIGATE OR FIGHT - If the investigator is in a Safe space (no enemies
   present), draw a Discovery card that may grant items, companions, or
   conditions. If enemies are present, every enemy in the investigator's space
   attacks, rolling dice as shown on their reference card; each success deals
   a wound and each tentacle costs 1 sanity.
5. RESOLVE END OF TURN - Resolve any end-of-turn effects, check fire tokens,
   check the Mythos discard pile for Elder One summoning symbols (3 symbols
   advance the Elder One along its summoning track and reshuffle the Mythos
   deck), check whether the Elder One is summoned, and resolve any Elder One
   end-of-turn effects.

The game proceeds through two phases. In Phase One, investigators must complete
episode-specific objectives to disrupt the ritual (e.g., destroying labs, closing
gates, or other tasks defined by the chosen Episode card). Once the ritual is
disrupted, the Elder One is summoned and can now be attacked — Phase Two begins:
a direct boss fight where investigators must defeat all of the Elder One's Stages
before the Progression token reaches the end of the summoning track or all
investigators are eliminated.

### Key Design Patterns

INSANITY AS POWER SOURCE: The sanity track is the game's central risk-reward
mechanism and its most original design contribution. As investigators lose sanity
(from tentacle results on any dice roll, or Mythos effects), they advance along a
personal sanity track toward madness. Each Insanity Threshold on the track
activates an insanity card, levels up a skill, and some thresholds permanently add
a bonus die to all rolls. However, reaching the end of the track means death. The design creates a non-obvious
optimal play pattern: investigators who are too cautious remain weak, unable to
match the escalating threat. Investigators who embrace insanity gain the power
needed to fight the Elder God but risk elimination before the final battle. The
sweet spot is deliberate, controlled descent into madness — taking just enough
stress to unlock key abilities without crossing the lethal threshold. This
transforms what would normally be a health bar into a strategic resource, and it
gives players a reason to welcome the very thing they are nominally trying to
avoid.

SCENARIO-BASED NARRATIVE STRUCTURE: Each game uses one Episode (the scenario) and
one Elder God, combined modularly. Episodes define the map layout, the ritual
objectives, the Mythos deck composition, and the narrative arc. Elder Gods define
the boss-fight mechanics, the unique monsters that spawn, and global effects that
alter gameplay. This two-axis modularity means the same Episode plays differently
against different Elder Gods, and the same Elder God presents different challenges
across different Episodes. The design avoids the "solved scenario" problem common
in cooperative games: even if players have mastered an Episode, pairing it with an
unfamiliar Elder God forces adaptation. The narrative is embedded in the scenario
structure rather than delivered through lengthy text — players experience the
story through the sequence of objectives and the escalating mechanical pressure,
not through reading flavor paragraphs.

DICE MITIGATION THROUGH CONTROLLED INSANITY: The dice system uses custom dice
with successes, blanks, Elder Signs, and tentacles (which cost 1 sanity each).
Investigators may take stress to reroll any die on any roll, as many times as they
choose. The tentacle faces create a built-in risk in every roll: attacking a monster
might erode your sanity as much as being attacked by one. But because reaching
Insanity Thresholds grants powers, tentacle results are not purely negative —
they are a forced investment in your sanity track's progression. Equipment cards and
character abilities provide reroll and dice-manipulation effects, giving players
agency over the randomness. The interplay between dice luck, mitigation abilities,
and insanity advancement means that even a "bad" roll can be strategically
acceptable if the resulting stress pushes you to a valuable insanity threshold.
The dice are not a resolution mechanism — they are a negotiation between risk and
power.

BOSS-FIGHT CLIMAX STRUCTURE: The two-phase design — disruption followed by
confrontation — gives every game a built-in dramatic arc. Phase One is a
scavenger hunt under pressure, with investigators spreading across the map to
complete objectives while managing monster spawns. Phase Two collapses the game
into a single spatial focus as the Elder God manifests and investigators converge
for the final battle. This structural shift mirrors the pacing of horror cinema:
the slow build of investigation followed by the explosive confrontation. It also
creates a natural strategic pivot point — abilities and equipment that were
valuable for Phase One (mobility, investigation) become less important in Phase
Two (raw damage output, survival), forcing players to balance short-term and
long-term needs throughout the game.

ESCALATING TIMER VIA MYTHOS DECK: The Mythos deck serves as both narrative engine
and countdown clock. Every turn, one card is drawn from the Episode's Mythos deck,
triggering effects that spawn monsters, advance the summoning track, and generally
make the situation worse. The deck is finite: when it runs out, the investigators
lose. This creates a constant pressure to act efficiently. But the Mythos deck
is not purely adversarial — the pace and content of its reveals create a narrative
rhythm. Early Mythos cards might introduce minor cultists and environmental clues;
later cards unleash major threats and catastrophic events. The deck is designed as
a difficulty curve, not a random event generator, and this curation is what gives
each scenario its specific feel and pacing.

MODULAR BOARD AS TACTICAL ENVIRONMENT: The map is assembled from room tiles
specific to each Episode, creating a unique spatial puzzle each game. Rooms have
different properties — some provide cover, some contain ritual components, some
funnel movement through chokepoints. The modular design means players cannot
memorize optimal paths across sessions; they must read the board state and adapt.
Monster placement relative to room geometry creates tactical decisions about where
to engage, where to avoid, and how to position investigators to support each other.
The board is small enough that movement is not tedious but large enough that
spatial positioning matters — a classic corridor-crawler balance.

COMPANION AND EQUIPMENT AS ABILITY MODIFIERS: Investigators find equipment and
recruit companions during play, and these cards modify their dice pools, grant
special actions, or provide passive bonuses. The item system is deliberately
streamlined — each investigator can hold limited items, and companions attach to
specific card slots. This prevents the inventory-management bloat that plagues
many dungeon-crawl games. Items are impactful but simple, often granting a single
extra die or a once-per-turn reroll. The restraint in item complexity keeps the
focus on the core insanity-versus-power decision rather than drowning it in
combinatorial optimization.

### What Makes It #52

Cthulhu: Death May Die succeeds by violating genre expectations. Where most
Lovecraftian games are about dread and prevention, this one is about empowerment
and confrontation — and it uses the insanity mechanic to reconcile that tonal
shift with the source material. You are not powerful despite going mad; you are
powerful because you go mad, and the game asks you to manage that descent with
the precision of a resource-optimization puzzle. The two-phase structure gives
every session a cinematic arc, the modular Episode-plus-Elder-God system provides
strong replayability without rules overhead, and the dice system turns every roll
into a micro-negotiation between short-term safety and long-term capability. Daviau
and Lang have designed a game that makes Lovecraftian horror feel like an action
movie without losing the sense that the odds are cosmically stacked against you.
The insanity track is the fulcrum: it transforms a cooperative dice-chucker into
something with genuine strategic texture by making the thing you fear also the
thing you need.
