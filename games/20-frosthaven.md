## Design Notes

Designer: Isaac Childres (lead game designer), with Alexander
JL Theoharis, Joe Homes, and Zachary Cohn designing the event
system, building system, campaign, battle goals, and challenge
mechanics. Published by Cephalofair Games (2023).

### Theme Integration

Frosthaven shifts the Gloomhaven formula from mercenaries-
for-hire in a bustling city to a desperate frontier outpost on
the frozen northern edge of the world. Where Gloomhaven's
mercenaries were self-interested contractors, Frosthaven's
party is a community defending its home. The outpost is under
siege from Algox, Lurkers, and other threats -- the very first
scenario is titled "A Town in Flames." This reframing transforms
the meta-game: you are not just dungeon-crawling for personal
gain, you are gathering resources, building structures, and
fortifying defenses so your settlement survives. The 138
scenarios branch through a narrative with seasonal rhythms
(summer and winter), each bringing different road events,
outpost events, and attack frequencies. Six starting classes
(Banner Spear, Drifter, Boneshaper, Deathwalker, Blinkblade,
Geminate) reflect the harsh frontier -- summoners of the undead,
insect-swarm shapeshifters, spirit manipulators -- stranger and
more mechanically daring than Gloomhaven's initial roster. An
additional 11 locked classes await discovery through campaign
progression, for 17 total.

### Core Loop

Frosthaven operates on two interlocking loops: the Scenario
Phase (tactical dungeon combat) and the Outpost Phase
(settlement management).

**Scenario Phase** (largely inherited from Gloomhaven):

1. CARD SELECTION - Each player secretly picks 2 ability cards;
   one sets initiative. Communication restrictions remain:
   discuss general strategy, never share specific numbers.
2. INITIATIVE - All characters and monster types reveal; lowest
   initiative acts first. Players and monsters interleave.
3. CHARACTER AND MONSTER TURNS - Play top of one card, bottom
   of the other. Monsters follow deterministic AI via ability
   cards and focus rules. Cards-as-life mechanic intact.
4. END OF ROUND - Elements wane, short rests available.

**Outpost Phase** (entirely new to Frosthaven):

1. PASSAGE OF TIME - Mark the campaign calendar. Every 10 weeks
   triggers a season change (summer to winter or vice versa).
   Certain weeks trigger section book entries -- timed narrative.
2. OUTPOST EVENT - Draw from seasonal deck. Front: narrative
   choice. Back: attack on Frosthaven with defense checks.
3. BUILDING OPERATIONS - Resolve effects of all constructed
   buildings in sequential order (normal or wrecked effects).
4. DOWNTIME - Level up, retire/create characters, craft items,
   brew potions, sell/purchase items. Each activity may require
   interacting with a specific building.
5. CONSTRUCTION - Build, upgrade, or rebuild one building
   (optionally a second at the cost of 2 morale).

### Key Design Patterns

OUTPOST MANAGEMENT AS META-GAME: The single largest departure
from Gloomhaven. The outpost of Frosthaven is not just a menu
screen between scenarios -- it is a living system with its own
economy, threats, and progression arc. Buildings have cards with
normal and wrecked sides; they provide interactions during
Downtime and passive effects during Building Operations. The
Barracks determines soldier capacity for defense checks. The
Craftsman enables item crafting. The Alchemist enables potion
brewing. The Workshop provides... something behind a sticker.
New buildings are unlocked through character retirement (sealed
envelopes with new rules, personal quests, and building cards).
Buildings require resources and prosperity levels to construct
and upgrade. This creates a resource allocation tension that
Gloomhaven never had: do you spend lumber upgrading the
Alchemist or save it for repairing buildings after an attack?

RESOURCE ECONOMY AS CONNECTIVE TISSUE: Frosthaven introduces
three material resources (lumber, metal, hide) and six herb
resources (arrowvine, axenut, corpsecap, flamefruit, rockroot,
snowthistle). Resources exist in two pools: character personal
supply and the Frosthaven collective supply. Characters can
donate to the collective but cannot withdraw from it. Material
resources in the collective pay for buildings; personal material
resources pay for crafting. Herb resources from either pool
fuel potion brewing and crafting. This dual-pool design creates
genuine collective resource dilemmas. In Gloomhaven, gold was
purely individual. Here, every looted resource card forces a
decision: keep it for personal crafting or donate it to fund
the outpost's survival.

LOOT DECK REPLACING LOOT SCATTERING: Instead of coins scattered
on the map at scenario start, each scenario constructs a custom
loot deck from money cards, material resource cards, herb
resource cards, and random item cards. When a character loots a
token, they draw from this deck. Material resource cards scale
with player count. This shifts loot from a purely positional
race (stand on the gold hex) to a deck-driven reward system
that feeds directly into the crafting and building economies.
Monsters still drop loot tokens on death, preserving the
tactical tension of positioning versus objectives, but the
rewards are richer and more varied.

CRAFTING AND ALCHEMY SYSTEMS: Items are no longer just purchased
from a shop -- they are crafted at the Craftsman building using
resources and prerequisite items. A Crude Shield can be upgraded
to a Reinforced Shield by spending resources and returning the
base item. Item blueprints are discovered through treasures and
scenario rewards, gradually expanding what can be crafted. The
Alchemist building enables potion brewing by combining two herb
resources, with an alchemy chart whose windows start sealed --
each new combination permanently reveals its result. At level 2,
potions can be distilled back into herbs. At level 3, three-herb
potions unlock. This discovery mechanic adds exploration to the
economy: you do not know what a potion does until you brew it
for the first time.

SEASONAL CALENDAR AND TIMED NARRATIVE: The campaign calendar
tracks time in weeks, with 10 weeks per season and two seasons
(summer and winter) per year. Certain calendar boxes contain
section book references that trigger automatically -- narrative
events on a fixed timeline regardless of player actions. Season
determines which road event and outpost event decks are active.
Winter outpost events feature more frequent and more dangerous
attacks on Frosthaven. This creates pacing pressure absent from
Gloomhaven: the world advances whether you are ready or not.

DEFENSE CHECKS AND THE TOWN GUARD DECK: When attack events
target Frosthaven, the party performs defense checks for each
targeted building. The town guard deck functions like a personal
attack modifier deck for the outpost itself -- a 20-card deck
with +0, +10, -10, +20, -20, and special cards. The party's
total defense value (tracked on the campaign sheet) plus the
drawn card must meet or exceed the attack value. Soldiers can be
spent to reduce attack values and grant advantage. If a check
fails, the building is damaged (requiring immediate resource
payment) or wrecked (flipped to its wrecked side, losing its
normal function). Over the campaign, the town guard deck is
customized through perk marks -- mirroring the personal attack
modifier deck improvement at the character level. This elegant
parallel means the outpost itself levels up.

MORALE AND INSPIRATION TRACKS: Two new campaign currencies.
Morale (0-20) affects Frosthaven's total defense modifier and
can be spent for extra builds or to skip repairs. Hitting 0 or
20 triggers section book entries -- narrative consequences for
community despair or triumph. Inspiration is gained when
completing scenarios (4 minus number of characters) and can
substitute for material resources when paying costs. It also
fuels a retirement option: spend 15 inspiration to complete an
additional personal quest. These tracks create campaign-level
stakes beyond individual character progression.

MASTERIES AS SKILL CHALLENGES: Each character class has two
masteries -- specific in-scenario achievements (e.g., "Attack
at least three enemies with each of three different area of
effect attack abilities"). Achieving a mastery earns a perk
mark even if the character was exhausted. Masteries reward
skillful play of a class's unique mechanics and provide
intermediate goals between leveling milestones. They also
persist as entries in the retirement table, tying individual
mastery to campaign legacy.

REFINED CARD PLAY AND CHARACTER DESIGN: While the core cards-
as-life and split-card systems are inherited from Gloomhaven,
Frosthaven's six starting classes push mechanical boundaries
further. The Geminate has two separate forms (melee and ranged)
with different miniatures, switching between them. The
Boneshaper sacrifices their own health to create undead summons.
The Deathwalker manipulates shadow tokens dropped by dying
figures. The Blinkblade uses a fast/slow time mechanic. These
classes demonstrate five more years of design iteration on the
core system, with more conditional triggers, use-slot tracking
on persistent bonuses, and deeper elemental synergies.

CHALLENGE CARDS AS DIFFICULTY TUNING: Frosthaven includes 45
challenge cards providing granular difficulty adjustment beyond
the scenario level slider. Combined with the casual mode
(campaign-free play), solo mode (increased difficulty formula),
reduced randomness variant, and open information variant, the
game offers more accessibility levers than its predecessor --
acknowledging that a 100+ hour campaign needs to accommodate
changing group dynamics.

RETIREMENT UNLOCKS BUILDINGS, NOT JUST CLASSES: In Gloomhaven,
retiring a character unlocked a new class. In Frosthaven,
retirement also unlocks a building envelope. The new building
must still be constructed (requiring resources and prosperity),
but its sealed envelope contains new rules, stickers for the
rulebook, and building cards. This means retirement has outpost-
level consequences -- not just new characters to play, but new
systems and interactions for the entire group.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1-4 players: Monster placement scales per scenario via
  color-coded bars (2/3/4 characters map to top/middle/bottom
  bars; black = no monster, white = normal, yellow = elite)
- Scenario level = average character level / 2 (rounded up);
  scales monster stats, gold conversion, trap damage, hazardous
  terrain damage, and bonus experience (level 0-7 range)
- Solo mode: add 1 to average level before dividing by 2,
  increasing difficulty to compensate for perfect information
- Loot deck material resource cards provide scaling yields
  based on character count
- Equation-based objectives and named monsters (e.g., HP =
  C x H where C = characters, H = elite HP) scale to party
- Town guard defense system scales indirectly through building
  upgrades and perk improvements over the campaign

### What Makes It #20

Frosthaven is the answer to the question "what if Gloomhaven's
campaign had a second axis of progression?" The scenario-level
tactical combat remains superb -- cards-as-life, split-card
decisions, automated monsters, initiative gambling -- but the
Outpost Phase transforms the connective tissue between scenarios
from a shopping menu into a genuine strategic layer. The resource
economy creates collective decision-making that Gloomhaven's
individual gold never achieved. The seasonal calendar and attack
events give the world a pulse independent of player choices.
The crafting and alchemy systems reward exploration and long-
term planning. And the defense checks -- with their own modifier
deck that improves over the campaign -- make the outpost feel
like a character in its own right. If Gloomhaven proved that a
Euro-style card system could power a dungeon crawler, Frosthaven
proves that the same engine can support an entire settlement
simulation layered on top. Its lower ranking relative to
Gloomhaven (#4) reflects the tension inherent in that ambition:
more systems means more overhead, longer setup, and a steeper
on-ramp -- but for groups who commit to the full campaign, the
interlocking loops of fight, build, and survive create a
cooperative experience with no real peer.
