## Design Notes

Designers: Helge Ostertag and Jens Drogemuller. Published by
Feuerland Verlagsgesellschaft / Z-Man Games (2017). A spiritual
successor to Terra Mystica, reimagined in a sci-fi setting with
modular boards and a research track system that replaces the
fixed cult tracks.

### Theme Integration

Fourteen alien factions compete to colonize the Terra Mystica
galaxy. Each faction has evolved for a specific planetary
environment — desert, swamp, oxide, volcanic, titanium, ice,
or terra — and must terraform incompatible worlds before
settling them. The sci-fi reskin is not cosmetic: it justifies
the modular hex-tile board (assembling a galaxy from sector
tiles), the Gaia phase (transforming barren Transdim Planets
into habitable Gaia worlds via time-delayed projects), and the
navigation research track (expanding your faction's range
across empty space). The power cycle represents an alien
energy source that must be charged through proximity to other
civilizations — a mechanical metaphor for the diplomatic
friction of coexisting in a shared galaxy. Federations are
interplanetary alliances formed by linking colonized worlds,
and the research board tracks six domains of technological
progress. The theme gives every mechanism a narrative anchor.

### Core Loop

Six rounds, each with four phases: Income, Gaia, Actions,
Clean-Up. The action phase is the heart — players take single
actions in turn order until all have passed:

1. BUILD A MINE - Colonize a planet within range (pay
   terraforming costs if not your home type)
2. START A GAIA PROJECT - Commit power tokens to convert
   a Transdim Planet into a Gaia Planet next round
3. UPGRADE STRUCTURE - Advance mine to trading station,
   then to research lab or planetary institute, then to academy
4. FORM A FEDERATION - Connect structures with total power
   value of 7+, gain a federation token
5. RESEARCH PROGRESS - Spend 4 knowledge to advance one
   level on any research track
6. POWER/Q.I.C. ACTIONS - Spend power or Q.I.C. for
   one-time board actions (once per round each)
7. SPECIAL ACTIONS - Use faction-specific or tech tile actions
8. PASS - Take a new round booster; exit the round

Passing sets next-round turn order (first to pass goes first)
and triggers scoring on certain round boosters. End-game
scoring rewards research track progress, final scoring tile
rankings, and leftover resources.

### Key Design Patterns

TERRAFORMING AS SPATIAL ECONOMY: The cost to colonize a
planet scales with its habitat distance from your home type.
Seven planet colors are arranged on a circular wheel; each
step away costs ore based on your Terraforming research
level (3 ore per step at level 0, down to 1 ore at levels 3+).
This creates faction-specific geography — the same board
presents radically different cost landscapes to each player.
A planet that is cheap for one faction is expensive for another,
producing natural territorial differentiation without explicit
area-control rules.

FACTION ASYMMETRY AS RULE MUTATIONS: The 14 factions
(on 7 double-sided boards) do not merely tweak starting
resources. Each faction alters fundamental rules. The Ivits
place a planetary institute instead of mines and build space
stations; the Xenos place a third starting mine after all
others; the Geodens gain knowledge per new planet type
colonized; the Taklons' Brainstone counts as one token but
spends as three power; the Gleens gain ore instead of Q.I.C.
and earn bonus VP per Gaia Planet. These are not stat
variations — they are mechanical identity, forcing each
faction into a distinct strategic posture.

THE POWER CYCLE: Power tokens rotate through three
numbered areas (I, II, III) on your faction board. Charging
moves tokens from I to II or II to III. Spending moves
tokens from III back to I. This closed-loop resource creates
a tempo problem: you need tokens in area III to act, but
getting them there requires multiple charges. Gaining new
tokens (from supply to area I) increases total capacity but
those tokens start uncharged. The free action to discard a
token from area II to instantly move one to area III creates
a permanent sacrifice for immediate power — an elegant
tension between long-term capacity and short-term access.

PASSIVE CHARGING — PROXIMITY AS INTERACTION: When any
player builds or upgrades a structure, opponents within range
2 may charge power equal to the highest-power-value structure
they own in that neighborhood — but must spend VP equal to
the charge minus one (charge 3 costs 2 VP). This is the game's
primary interaction mechanic. Building near opponents gives
them power but costs them VP. Players must constantly decide
whether to accept the charge or decline it. Clustering near
rivals provides mutual charging opportunities but also
competition for planets. Isolation means freedom to expand
but starvation of power income.

RESEARCH TRACKS AS BRANCHING UPGRADES: Six tracks
(Terraforming, Navigation, Artificial Intelligence, Gaia
Project, Economy, Science) each have six levels (0-5). Only
one player can claim level 5 per track, and doing so requires
flipping a federation token to its gray side — the same cost
as taking an advanced tech tile. Each track delivers different
reward profiles: Terraforming reduces colonization costs,
Navigation extends range, Economy provides escalating
income, Science grants knowledge. The level 5 race creates
targeted competition within specific tracks while the breadth
of six tracks allows strategic divergence.

FEDERATION BUILDING AS SPATIAL PUZZLE: Forming a
federation requires connecting your colonized planets so
that the structures on them total power value 7 or more
(mines = 1, trading stations/research labs = 2, planetary
institutes/academies = 3). Non-adjacent planets must be
linked by satellites, which cost one power each and are
placed in empty spaces. Once formed, a federation's planets
and satellites cannot belong to another federation. This
creates a spatial optimization puzzle — you want to cluster
structures efficiently while still expanding to new planets.
The reward is a federation token providing VP and resources,
plus the token itself serves as currency for level-5 research
or advanced tech tiles.

GAIA PHASE AS TEMPORAL INVESTMENT: Starting a Gaia
Project requires moving power tokens to your Gaia area,
locking them away for an entire round. The Gaia phase at the
start of the next round returns them to area I (or area II for
Terrans). This is a delayed-return investment: you sacrifice
current-round power capacity to gain a colonizable Gaia
Planet next round. The Gaia Project research track reduces
the power cost (6 tokens at levels 0-1, down to 3 at levels
4-5) and grants Gaiaformers as one-time bonuses. Since
Gaiaformers are limited (3 per player, gained at Gaia Project
research levels 1, 3, and 4), the timing and sequencing of
Gaia Projects becomes a critical resource-management puzzle.

ROUND BOOSTERS AS STRATEGIC DRAFTING: Each round,
players select a new booster tile when they pass (returning
their current one). Boosters provide income and often a
pass-triggered scoring bonus (e.g., 1 VP per mine, 3 VP per
research lab, 4 VP per planetary institute/academy). Since
boosters are drafted in pass order, there is tension between
passing early (to secure the best booster and first-player
position) and staying in the round longer (to take more
actions). This creates a natural game clock — once an
attractive booster is available, players race to pass at the
right moment.

STRUCTURE UPGRADE ECONOMY: The upgrade path
(mine -> trading station -> research lab/planetary institute
-> academy) reveals income spaces on your faction board.
Each structure removed exposes higher income values beneath
it. But upgrading also requires the previous structure on the
board, so expansion (more mines) competes with development
(upgrading existing structures). Trading stations cost less
when adjacent to an opponent's structure (6 credits/2 ore vs.
3 credits/2 ore), rewarding proximity — another incentive to
build near rivals despite the power-charging trade-off.

TECH TILES AS MODULAR BONUSES: Nine standard tech tiles
(randomly placed on the research board) and six advanced tech
tiles create variable scoring and strategy conditions each game.
Standard tiles provide ongoing income or triggered VP bonuses.
Advanced tiles offer larger rewards but require level 4-5
research and flipping a federation token. The randomized
placement means the optimal research path changes every
game, preventing formulaic strategies.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1-2 players: 7 sector tiles (01-07), outlined sides on
  tiles 05/06/07; neutral satellites on ranking tracks
  set minimum thresholds for final scoring
- 3-4 players: all 10 sector tiles, solid sides on 05/06/07
- Round boosters: player count + 3 available each round
  (e.g., 7 in a 4-player game)
- Variable board assembly (3 methods of increasing
  randomness) ensures different spatial puzzles
- The constraint that same planet types cannot be directly
  adjacent during variable setup prevents degenerate
  clustering at any player count
- Solo mode uses Automa cards and decision cards to
  simulate an opponent

### What Makes It #13

The layered decision space. Every action touches multiple
systems simultaneously: building a mine costs resources,
reveals income, extends your network toward federations,
potentially charges opponents' power, advances you toward
round scoring conditions, and claims spatial territory. The
power cycle adds a resource-management dimension that has
no equivalent in most euro games — it is not a stockpile to
spend but a flow to manage, where timing and throughput
matter as much as quantity. The 14 factions do not just offer
variety; they force genuinely different strategic frameworks,
as each faction's rule mutations interact differently with the
modular board, randomized tech tiles, and round scoring
conditions. Gaia Project inherits Terra Mystica's core tension
between proximity (for power charging and cheaper trading
stations) and isolation (for spatial freedom), then deepens
it with research track racing, Gaia Project timing puzzles,
and a modular galaxy that never presents the same strategic
landscape twice. It is one of the heaviest games in the BGG
top 25, and its complexity is not ornamental — every system
interlocks with every other, rewarding mastery across dozens
of plays.
