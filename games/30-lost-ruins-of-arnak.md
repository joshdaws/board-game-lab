## Design Notes

Designers: Elwen (Michaela Štachová) & Mín (Michal Štach). Published by Czech
Games Edition (2020).

### Theme Integration

An archaeological expedition to a mysterious island — and the theme does real
structural work, not just atmospheric dressing. Players are rival explorers
uncovering ruins, confronting guardians, and piecing together the island's
secrets. Each mechanical system maps to an expedition narrative: worker
placement is sending your two archaeologists to dig sites, deckbuilding is
acquiring better equipment (items) and discovering powerful relics (artifacts),
the research track is assembling academic knowledge from your findings, and
guardians are the dangers that punish reckless exploration with Fear cards that
clog your deck like trauma from a failed encounter. Discovering a new site
flips a tile, revealing both its reward and its guardian — mechanically elegant
and thematically perfect, since you don't know what you'll find until you get
there. The dual-use card system (play for effect OR spend as travel cost) maps
to the idea that your gear and discoveries are also your means of reaching
remote locations. Compass and tablet icons on cards represent the navigation
tools and scholarly knowledge needed to push deeper into the island. Even the
resource palette reinforces the theme: coins fund purchases at base camp,
compasses navigate jungle paths, tablets unlock research insights, and
arrowheads, gems, and rubies represent increasingly rare archaeological finds.

### Core Loop

The game plays over exactly 5 rounds. Each round, players draw 5 cards from
their personal deck (starting at 10 cards), then take turns performing one
action each until all players pass. The tight round structure creates urgency
— there is no sixth round, so every action across all 5 rounds must count.

Key actions available each turn:

1. DIG AT A SITE - Place an archaeologist meeple on a board site. Basic sites
   cost a compass or tablet token; distant sites require cards with matching
   travel icons. Gain the site's resource reward. Discovering a new site flips
   a tile and summons a guardian.
2. BUY A CARD - Purchase an item (cheaper, versatile) or artifact (expensive,
   powerful) from the card row, adding it to your discard pile.
3. PLAY A CARD - Play a card from hand for its printed effect (resources,
   actions, research advancement, guardian combat assistance).
4. ADVANCE ON THE RESEARCH TRACK - Spend tablets and other resources to move
   your marker up the multi-tiered research track, claiming bonuses and
   end-game VP.
5. DEFEAT A GUARDIAN - Spend the required resource combination shown on a
   guardian tile to defeat it, gaining VP and removing the threat.
6. USE AN ASSISTANT - Activate a previously gained assistant tile for its
   special ability, providing actions beyond normal worker placement.

End-game scoring tallies research track position, purchased cards, defeated
guardians, collected idol tokens, and various bonuses. The player with the
most VP wins.

### Key Design Patterns

HYBRID ENGINE — DECKBUILDING MEETS WORKER PLACEMENT: The game's central
innovation is weaving two traditionally separate systems into a single
decision space. Worker placement gives you resources and board presence;
deckbuilding gives you capabilities and efficiency. But the two systems are
not parallel — they are interdependent. Cards provide travel icons needed to
reach worker placement sites, and worker placement sites provide resources
needed to buy cards. This creates a chicken-and-egg dynamic in the early game:
you need cards to reach good sites, but you need site rewards to buy good
cards. The designers solved this elegantly by making basic sites accessible
with tokens (no cards needed) while gating premium sites behind card-based
travel costs. Your deck is both your action economy and your transport
infrastructure.

DUAL-USE CARDS: Every card in your deck has two possible uses — play it for
its printed effect, or spend it as a travel cost using its compass/tablet
icons. This forces a constant tension: a card with a powerful effect and a
rare travel icon is always a painful choice. Do you play it for its ability,
or burn it to reach a lucrative site? The decision is further sharpened by the
small deck size. With only 15-20 cards by game end and draws of 5 per round,
you see most of your deck every round. This means every card acquisition
permanently shapes your capabilities — there is no "I'll never see that card
again" buffer that larger deckbuilders provide. The dual-use system also
eliminates dead turns: even a hand full of weak cards can serve as travel
currency.

FEAR CARDS AS NEGATIVE DECKBUILDING: Undefeated guardians add Fear cards to
your deck — cards with no useful effect and no travel icons. In a tight 15-20
card deck where you draw 5 per round, even one Fear card meaningfully degrades
your draws. Two or three Fear cards can be crippling. This creates a powerful
incentive loop: explore sites to gain resources, but exploring summons
guardians, and ignoring guardians pollutes your deck. The Fear mechanic is
more punishing here than in most deckbuilders because the deck stays small.
In a game like Dominion with 30+ card decks, a curse is diluted; in Arnak,
a Fear card represents 5-7% of your total deck. The designers use deck
pollution not as a random penalty but as a direct consequence of a player
choice — you chose to explore, you accepted the guardian risk.

FIVE-ROUND HARD CLOCK: The fixed 5-round structure is one of the game's most
important design decisions. There is no variable game length, no "play until
the deck runs out," no parameter-triggered ending. You get exactly 5 rounds,
and the number of actions per round is limited by your cards, workers, and
assistants. This hard clock fundamentally changes the deckbuilding calculus.
In most deckbuilders, buying an engine card early pays off over many future
shuffles. In Arnak, a card bought in round 3 will cycle through your deck at
most twice more. A card bought in round 5 may never be drawn at all — you are
buying it purely for its purchase bonus or end-game VP value. The 5-round
clock forces players to shift from engine-building to point-scoring earlier
than most engine-building games demand, and the optimal transition point is
one of the game's central strategic puzzles.

RESEARCH TRACK AS PARALLEL SCORING AXIS: The research track provides an
alternative to the explore-and-fight loop. Advancing requires tablets and
specific resources, offering escalating bonuses (resources, assistants,
end-game VP) at each tier. The track is structured so that early tiers are
cheap and provide utility (resources, assistants that give extra actions),
while upper tiers are expensive and provide raw VP. This creates a natural
strategic arc: invest in the research track early for its utility returns,
then push for the VP-rich upper tiers in the final rounds. The research track
also acts as a strategic counterweight to exploration — a player who focuses
on research and card effects can compete with a player who aggressively
explores sites and defeats guardians. Neither path is dominant, and the best
strategies blend both.

ASSISTANTS AS ACTION EXPANSION: The Moon Staff and assistant tiles provide
actions beyond the two-worker baseline. Assistants are gained from the
research track and certain card effects, and each provides a unique once-per-
round ability. This system elegantly solves the worker placement scarcity
problem — with only 2 archaeologist meeples, unaugmented action economy is
extremely tight across 5 rounds. Assistants let players customize their action
palette: one player might gain an assistant that provides free resources,
another might gain one that advances the research track. The assistants also
create differentiation between players following similar strategies, since
the order in which assistants are claimed varies each game.

ITEM VS. ARTIFACT CARD ECONOMY: The card market splits into two distinct
pools. Items are cheaper and more versatile — they provide reliable resources
and travel icons, forming the workhorse backbone of your deck. Artifacts are
expensive but powerful — they offer dramatic effects that can reshape a round.
This split creates a natural strategic tension: items improve consistency,
artifacts improve ceiling. A deck full of items runs smoothly but lacks
explosive turns; a deck with too many artifacts may have hands where you
can't afford to play them or lack the travel icons to reach sites. The cost
differential also creates a tempo decision: buying a cheap item leaves
resources for other actions this turn, while buying an expensive artifact
consumes most of a turn's economic output.

IDOL TOKENS AS EXPLORATION INCENTIVE: When new sites are discovered, they
often reveal idol tokens worth end-game VP. Idols are a pure incentive to
explore — you cannot gain them any other way. They reward the player who takes
the risk of exploring (and facing guardians) with a non-replicable scoring
opportunity. The idol system ensures that even in games where the research
track dominates scoring, exploration remains valuable. It also creates
first-mover advantage on exploration, since idols are claimed immediately
upon discovery.

### What Makes It #30

Lost Ruins of Arnak succeeds by being a hybrid that feels like neither of its
parents. It is not a deckbuilder with a board bolted on, nor a worker
placement game with cards stapled to it — the two systems are genuinely fused
through the dual-use card mechanism and the resource-flow interdependency
between sites and purchases. The 5-round hard clock gives the game a tight
dramatic arc that many engine builders lack: you feel the pressure from round
1, and by round 4 every action carries genuine weight. The weight rating of
2.93 sits precisely in the design sweet spot between gateway and enthusiast
games — accessible enough that the archaeological theme and clean iconography
draw in newer players, but deep enough that experienced players find genuine
strategic texture in the card-versus-travel tradeoffs, the research track
pacing, and the guardian risk management. The Fear card mechanic gives
deckbuilding real consequences without requiring direct player conflict. And
the small deck size means every acquisition decision is meaningful in a way
that high-volume deckbuilders cannot match. Arnak proves that mechanical
hybridization works best when the systems share resources and create mutual
dependencies, rather than simply coexisting in the same box.
