### Theme Integration

Yokohama is set during the Meiji era of Japanese history, the
transformative period following the 1859 opening of Yokohama's port to
foreign trade. Players are rival merchants competing to build commercial
empires in this newly internationalized city. The theme captures a
specific historical moment — the collision between traditional Japanese
commerce and Western mercantile capitalism — and the game's mechanics
model the unique challenges of that transition. Players must navigate
both domestic Japanese markets (silk, tea, copper, seafood) and the
demands of foreign trading partners who require specific goods in
specific combinations. The dual commercial pressure creates a strategic
tension that mirrors the historical reality: Meiji-era merchants had
to simultaneously satisfy local demand and build export relationships
with Western nations whose preferences were unfamiliar and exacting.

The modular board represents Yokohama's commercial districts — the
harbor, the customs house, the laboratory for Western science, the
church representing foreign cultural influence, the traditional
Japanese marketplace, and various specialty shops. Each district
offers different actions and resources, and the physical arrangement
of districts changes each game, representing the organic development
of a rapidly modernizing city. The President (your main figure) must
physically travel between districts, moving through spaces occupied
by your assistants — a mechanic that models the reality of personal
business relationships in Meiji-era commerce. You cannot transact
remotely; you must be present, and your network of assistants
determines where you can efficiently travel.

The cultural exchange aspects of the Meiji period are embedded in
the game's systems. Building a church or laboratory represents
engagement with Western institutions. Importing foreign technology
(represented by technology cards) provides competitive advantages
that traditional methods cannot match. Establishing trade houses
reflects the permanent commercial infrastructure that merchants
built to facilitate ongoing international trade. The game does not
romanticize or simplify this period; it presents the Meiji opening
as a complex economic puzzle where traditional and foreign systems
must be integrated rather than one replacing the other.

### Core Loop

The game continues until a set number of achievement milestones are
collectively reached (scaling by player count), at which point the
current round is completed and final scoring occurs.

**ON YOUR TURN, PERFORM TWO SEQUENTIAL STEPS:**

**Step 1 — PLACE ASSISTANTS (mandatory)**

Place up to three assistant tokens from your supply onto any district
spaces on the board. Assistants can be placed on any spaces regardless
of distance or connection — they represent your commercial network
spreading across the city. Each district space can hold assistants
from multiple players. The number and placement of your assistants
determines both the power of your actions and your President's
movement options.

**Step 2 — MOVE AND ACT (mandatory)**

Move your President figure from its current location to an adjacent
district, passing through connected spaces. Your President may only
move to a district through spaces that contain at least one of your
assistants — your commercial network is literally the infrastructure
that enables your movement. Upon arriving at a district, the
President executes that district's action with a power level equal
to the number of your assistants present in that district plus one
(for the President). After acting, all your assistants in that
district return to your supply for future placement.

**Key district actions include:**

1. MARKETPLACE — Acquire goods (silk, tea, copper, seafood) based on
   action power. Higher power yields more goods or rarer combinations.

2. HARBOR — Ship goods to fulfill foreign trade contracts. Contracts
   require specific good combinations and award victory points, coins,
   and trade house placements.

3. CUSTOMS HOUSE — Gain import/export licenses that provide ongoing
   benefits and end-game scoring. Licenses are limited and contested.

4. LABORATORY — Acquire technology cards that provide permanent
   gameplay bonuses. Technologies range from movement enhancements to
   production efficiency to scoring multipliers.

5. CHURCH — Gain foreign influence and cultural exchange bonuses.
   Church advancement provides both immediate benefits and end-game
   scoring based on total engagement.

6. SPECIALTY SHOPS — Each specialty district provides a focused
   resource or ability tied to specific goods or contract types.

**BUILDING TRADE HOUSES**

When fulfilling contracts or completing certain achievements, players
may place trade houses on district spaces. Trade houses count as
permanent assistants in that district, increasing action power for
future visits and providing ongoing movement connectivity. Trade
houses also score end-game points based on their network configuration.

**FULFILLING ORDERS AND ACHIEVEMENTS**

Throughout the game, players can fulfill order cards (requiring specific
good combinations for VP and bonuses) and pursue achievement milestones
(building a certain number of trade houses, acquiring technologies,
advancing on the church track). Achievements collectively trigger the
end game.

**END GAME AND SCORING**

When the milestone threshold is reached, complete the current round
and score:

1. Victory points accumulated during play (contracts, orders, actions).
2. Trade house network bonuses (connected trade houses score more).
3. Achievement milestone bonuses.
4. Technology card end-game scoring.
5. Remaining resources converted to points at diminished rates.

### Key Design Patterns

ASSISTANT PLACEMENT AS NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE: Yokohama's most
distinctive mechanism is the separation of assistant placement (turn
step one) from President movement and action execution (turn step
two). Assistants are placed freely across the board, creating a
commercial network that determines both where the President can travel
and how powerful actions will be upon arrival. This two-phase structure
means you are constantly planning two turns ahead: placing assistants
this turn to enable powerful actions next turn, while simultaneously
executing actions through previously placed assistants. The system
models the reality of commercial networks — you invest in relationships
and infrastructure before you can exploit them, and the gap between
investment and payoff creates the game's primary planning challenge.

MOVEMENT THROUGH YOUR OWN NETWORK: The President can only move through
spaces containing your assistants, making your network literally your
infrastructure. This constraint transforms the modular board from a
simple action selection grid into a navigational puzzle. You cannot
simply go where you want; you can only go where your network reaches.
Expanding your network into new districts requires advance planning,
and opponents who place assistants in key transit districts benefit
from the connectivity without necessarily committing to those districts
as destinations. The movement constraint creates natural bottlenecks
and route competition — two players building networks in the same
area of the board must share transit spaces, creating interaction
through proximity rather than direct conflict.

ACTION POWER SCALING: The power of each district action scales with
the number of your assistants present, creating an investment-return
curve. Visiting a district with one assistant yields a basic action;
visiting with four assistants yields a transformative one. But
assistants spent on powering one district are unavailable for others
until returned to your supply after use. This creates a strategic
fork between concentration (few powerful actions) and distribution
(many weaker actions). The optimal balance shifts throughout the game
as different districts become more or less valuable based on contract
requirements and opponent positioning.

MODULAR BOARD AS STRATEGIC VARIABLE: The district tiles are arranged
differently each game, altering the geographic relationships between
actions. When the marketplace is adjacent to the harbor, goods
acquisition flows efficiently into contract fulfillment. When they
are separated by multiple districts, players must build longer
networks or accept less efficient routes. The variable setup prevents
memorized opening strategies and forces players to evaluate the
specific geography of each game. It also ensures that different
strategies vary in effectiveness from game to game — a technology-
focused approach might be geographically convenient in one layout
and cumbersome in another.

CONTRACT FULFILLMENT AS STRATEGIC DIRECTION: Contracts — requiring
specific combinations of goods for VP and bonuses — serve as the
game's strategic compass. Available contracts are visible to all
players, creating a race dynamic: the contract requiring three silk
and two tea can only be fulfilled by one player, so multiple merchants
pursuing the same goods creates market competition. Contract selection
determines which districts you need to visit, which goods you need to
acquire, and therefore which network topology you need to build. The
contract system converts the open-ended question of "what should I
do?" into the structured question of "which contracts should I
pursue?", providing strategic direction without eliminating player
agency.

TRADE HOUSES AS PERMANENT INFRASTRUCTURE: Trade houses placed on
district spaces count as permanent assistants — they increase action
power and provide movement connectivity for every future visit, at
no recurring cost. This creates a compounding advantage: districts
with your trade houses become increasingly efficient to use, pulling
your strategy toward repeated visits to the same locations. Trade
houses also score based on network connectivity at game end, rewarding
players who build coherent commercial networks rather than scattered
outposts. The permanent nature of trade houses means early placement
decisions have lasting strategic consequences — a well-placed trade
house in a central district provides value every remaining turn.

END-GAME TRIGGER AS COLLECTIVE PACING: The game ends when a collective
milestone threshold is reached, meaning all players contribute to
the game's pacing through their individual achievements. A player
pursuing achievements aggressively can accelerate the end game,
potentially catching opponents unprepared. Conversely, a player can
attempt to slow the pace by avoiding milestone achievements, buying
time for their engine to mature. The shared end-game trigger creates
a meta-strategic layer: the decision of when to end the game is
itself a competitive consideration, and the player who best
calibrates their strategy's completion timeline to the collective
pace gains a significant advantage.

SET COLLECTION THROUGH MULTIPLE CHANNELS: Goods, technologies,
contracts, and trade houses each form distinct collection dimensions
with independent scoring structures. The overlapping set collection
systems mean that a single action — acquiring a specific good, for
instance — might advance multiple collection goals simultaneously.
Players who identify synergies between collection dimensions score
more efficiently than those who pursue each dimension in isolation.
The multi-channel collection system ensures that every turn offers
multiple productive options, reducing downtime from blocked actions.

### What Makes It #155

Yokohama earns its ranking through the elegance of its network-based
movement and action system — the simple rule that your President
moves through your assistant network transforms a standard action
selection game into a spatial planning puzzle with genuine originality.
The Meiji-era theme is not just flavor; it informs the game's
structural logic of building commercial networks in a rapidly
modernizing city. The modular board ensures replayability while the
contract and achievement systems provide strategic direction without
prescribing solutions. Hisashi Hayashi created a game that occupies
a distinctive niche: heavier than typical network-building games,
more spatially dynamic than typical worker placement games, and more
thematically grounded than either. Its enduring presence in the top
rankings reflects a design that offers a unique mechanical identity —
the assistant-President duality — that no other game in the genre
has replicated as effectively.
