### Theme Integration

Grand Austria Hotel places players in turn-of-the-century Vienna, each managing
a grand hotel during the height of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The thematic
conceit is precise: guests arrive at your hotel with specific demands --
combinations of food, wine, cake, and coffee -- and you must prepare rooms of
the correct color, satisfy their culinary requests, and settle them into your
establishment. The hotel itself is a spatial grid of rooms across multiple
floors, each room requiring preparation before a guest can occupy it. This is
not a logistics abstraction; it models the actual operational challenge of
running a luxury hotel where every guest expects a specific standard of service.

The dice mechanism maps beautifully to the theme of a bustling city where
available opportunities shift day by day. Each round, a communal pool of dice is
rolled, and the faces determine which actions are available and how powerful
they are. Three dice showing a "4" means the action associated with value 4 is
exceptionally productive this round -- perhaps the kitchen is overflowing with
cake, or the staff is especially efficient at room preparation. This communal
randomness models the unpredictability of urban commerce: some days the
suppliers deliver abundantly, other days resources are scarce. Players must read
the current state of affairs and adapt their plans accordingly.

The Emperor track provides historical grounding. The Emperor of Austria-Hungary
periodically evaluates all hotels, and those that fail to meet his standards are
penalized. This is not merely a scoring mechanism -- it reflects the political
reality of operating a business under imperial authority, where royal favor
could make or break an establishment. The escalating expectations across three
rounds mirror a newly opened hotel's need to prove itself over time, with the
stakes rising as reputation becomes established.

### Core Loop

The game plays over three rounds of unequal length, determined by a shared
action die pool. Each round proceeds as follows:

1. ROLL DICE - All action dice (number varies by player count) are rolled and
   sorted by value onto a shared action board. Each value (1-6) corresponds to a
   specific action type. The number of dice on each value determines the
   action's power.
2. PLAYER TURNS - In turn order, each player selects one die from the pool,
   removing it. They perform the corresponding action with power equal to the
   number of dice that WERE on that value when they chose it (not after
   removal). Actions include: take food/wine resources (value 1-2), take
   cake/coffee resources (value 3-4), prepare hotel rooms (value 5), or hire
   staff cards (value 6). Taking 3 dice worth of an action is dramatically more
   productive than taking 1 die worth.
3. SETTLE GUESTS - At any point during their turn, a player may settle a guest
   card from their hand into a prepared room. The guest must receive their
   required combination of food, wine, cake, and coffee. The room must match the
   guest's color. Successfully settled guests provide immediate bonuses and end-
   game scoring.
4. STAFF ABILITIES - Staff cards purchased from the display provide persistent
   rule-breaking abilities or one-time bonuses. Staff activation may occur
   during or between main actions depending on the card's timing.
5. EMPEROR SCORING - At the end of each round, the Emperor evaluates all
   players. Specific requirements escalate each round (number of occupied rooms,
   guest diversity, etc.). Players meeting the threshold gain VP; those failing
   lose VP. The penalty for failure increases each round.
6. ROUND CLEANUP - Unoccupied guest cards in the cafe may be discarded. New
   guests arrive. The action board resets for the next round's dice roll.

After three rounds, final scoring adds VP from settled guests, completed
objective cards, Emperor track position, remaining resources, and staff card
bonuses.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE AS ACTION POWER: The central innovation of Grand Austria Hotel is that dice
determine not which actions exist but how powerful each action is. All six
action types are always available; the dice pool simply makes some vastly more
productive than others. When four dice show a "3," taking cake is extremely
efficient. When only one die shows "3," the same action yields minimal return.
This creates a shared tactical landscape that all players can read -- everyone
sees the same dice pool and can evaluate which actions are premium this round.
The design avoids the frustration of dice-as-gatekeeping (where bad rolls lock
you out of actions entirely) while preserving the strategic adaptation that
randomness demands.

DIMINISHING RETURNS THROUGH DRAFTING: Each die removed from the pool reduces the
power of that action for subsequent players. If three dice show "5" and the
first player takes one to prepare rooms at power 3, the next player taking a "5"
only gets power 2. This creates natural turn-order tension and a drafting
dynamic where choosing an action partly determines what your opponents can
accomplish. The decision to take a strong action you need versus a mediocre
action that denies opponents a strong one is the core tactical dilemma of every
turn.

GUEST CARDS AS MULTI-STEP OBJECTIVES: Each guest card is a miniature puzzle
requiring three things to align: the right resources in your supply, a prepared
room of the matching color, and the timing to settle them before they leave.
Guests are drawn into your hand from a shared cafe, creating a drafting layer on
top of the resource management. The multi-step nature means you must plan across
multiple turns -- acquire the guest, gather their preferred resources, prepare
the appropriate room -- and any disruption to one step cascades through the
entire plan. This gives the game a satisfying planning depth where experienced
players think three to four turns ahead.

STAFF CARDS AS RULE-BREAKING ABILITIES: The staff card market provides powerful
one-time or persistent effects that bend the game's core rules. One staff member
might let you treat any room as any color. Another might grant bonus resources
when you take a specific action. The staff system serves as the game's primary
source of strategic asymmetry -- two players can pursue radically different
approaches based on which staff cards they acquire early. Crucially, staff cards
cost an action to hire (taking a die from the "6" value), meaning investing in
staff directly competes with taking productive resource or room-preparation
actions. This opportunity cost prevents staff acquisition from becoming a
dominant strategy.

EMPEROR TRACK AS EXTERNAL PRESSURE: The Emperor's periodic evaluations create a
meta-structure that prevents players from pursuing their individual strategies
in isolation. You might prefer to focus entirely on high-value guests, but the
Emperor requires room diversity across colors. You might want to hoard resources
for a massive scoring turn, but the Emperor penalizes hotels with too few
occupants by the end of a round. This external pressure forces players to
maintain a baseline competence across multiple dimensions while still allowing
specialization. The escalating penalties (round 1 is mild, round 3 is severe)
create a natural difficulty curve where early mistakes are forgivable but late-
game failures are devastating.

ROOM PREPARATION AS SPATIAL PUZZLE: The hotel board is a grid of rooms across
three floors, with higher floors providing better bonuses but requiring more
preparation investment. Rooms must be prepared (flipped from closed to open)
before guests can occupy them, and preparation costs vary by floor. The spatial
arrangement creates adjacency considerations -- some bonuses trigger when an
entire floor is occupied. Players must decide between spreading guests across
floors for flexibility and concentrating on one floor for adjacency bonuses. The
physical hotel board also provides at-a-glance information about each player's
progress, enabling informed competitive decisions.

THREE-ROUND ESCALATION: The game's three-round structure creates distinct
strategic phases. Round 1 is about foundation -- acquiring your first guests,
hiring key staff, and establishing a resource engine. Round 2 is about execution
-- settling guests efficiently and building toward Emperor requirements. Round 3
is about optimization -- maximizing final scoring while meeting the Emperor's
harshest evaluation. The fixed three-round structure means every die choice
carries weight; there are no throwaway turns in a game that might offer only
18-24 total actions across its entire duration.

POLITICAL INFLUENCE AS ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY: Beyond the core hotel management
loop, players can invest in a political influence track that provides VP and
special privileges. Advancing on this track costs actions that could otherwise
be spent on hotel operations, creating a genuine strategic fork. A player who
invests heavily in political influence runs a smaller, less impressive hotel but
scores from a different axis. The track also provides tie-breaking benefits and
can unlock powerful one-time abilities. This secondary system ensures that the
game does not reduce to a single optimal path, rewarding players who read the
table state and identify undercontested scoring opportunities.

### What Makes It #67

Grand Austria Hotel solves the central problem of dice in strategy games: how to
introduce tactical variability without undermining strategic planning. The
communal dice pool creates a shared puzzle that changes every round, but the
consistently available action types mean you can always make progress on your
plans -- just not always at the efficiency you would prefer. The multi-layered
decision space (which die to take, which guest to pursue, which staff to hire,
how to satisfy the Emperor) ensures that no two games feel alike even though the
underlying systems are deterministic once the dice are rolled. Gigli and Luciani
achieved something rare: a game that feels different every time you play it
while remaining deeply skill-testing, because the skill lies in adaptation
rather than memorization. The theme of Viennese hotel management gives every
mechanism an intuitive explanation, making the game's considerable complexity
feel earned rather than arbitrary.
