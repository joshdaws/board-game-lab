### Theme Integration

Darwin's Journey is one of the most thematically committed worker placement
games in the modern canon. It does not merely borrow the Galapagos setting
for art direction — it uses Darwin's actual voyage aboard HMS Beagle as a
structural framework for every major system. Players are naturalists
following Darwin's route through the archipelago, collecting specimens,
cataloguing species, corresponding with European institutions, and
contributing to the growing body of evolutionary science. The map of the
Galapagos is not decorative; it is a network that constrains movement and
dictates which specimens are available where. The voyage track along the
bottom of the board represents the Beagle's progress through its
multi-year journey, and advancing along it unlocks new regions and
scoring opportunities that mirror the historical timeline of discovery.

What elevates the theme beyond setting is the worker competency system.
Each worker carries seals — small tokens representing acquired skills in
areas like navigation, exploration, correspondence, and study. Action
spaces on the board require specific seal combinations to access. A worker
cannot explore a remote island without navigation competency; they cannot
catalogue a rare specimen without the study seal. This is not an abstract
gate — it models the real process of scientific training. Darwin did not
arrive in the Galapagos fully formed as a naturalist; he developed skills
across the voyage. The game asks players to invest in their workers'
education before those workers can perform advanced research, creating a
parallel between gameplay investment and intellectual development that
makes the theme feel earned rather than applied.

The correspondence system further deepens the thematic integration. Players
send letters to institutions — museums, universities, scientific societies
— to gain reputation and unlock scoring opportunities. This models the
actual practice of 19th-century natural science, where field researchers
depended on institutional sponsorship and peer networks. Contributing
specimens to the museum creates a shared display that all players can
see and that tracks the collective progress of scientific knowledge.
The game's ultimate message is that science is both competitive (who gets
credit) and cooperative (the museum benefits everyone), and that tension
runs through every strategic decision.

### Core Loop

Darwin's Journey plays over five rounds, each divided into phases:

1. PLACEMENT PHASE — Starting with the first player, each player places
   one worker at a time onto an available action space. Workers must
   possess the required seal combination shown on the space. If a worker
   lacks the required seals, they cannot be placed there. More powerful
   action spaces require more and rarer seal combinations. Players
   alternate placements until all workers are deployed.

2. ACTION SPACES fall into several thematic categories:
   - EXPLORATION — Move across the Galapagos map by land or sea routes,
     placing exploration tokens and claiming specimens available at
     each location. Requires navigation seals. More remote islands
     require additional seals.
   - SPECIMEN COLLECTION — Gather animal and plant tokens from explored
     locations. Specimens serve dual purposes: they can be sent to
     institutions for reputation or contributed to the museum for
     set-based scoring.
   - CORRESPONDENCE — Send letters to European institutions. Each
     institution has specific specimen requirements and offers reputation
     and end-game scoring multipliers. Requires correspondence seals.
   - BEAGLE ADVANCEMENT — Move your marker along the Beagle's voyage
     track. Advancing unlocks new geographic regions and provides
     immediate bonuses (resources, seals, specimens). The track also
     triggers round-end scoring thresholds.
   - STUDY — Train a worker by adding a seal to their token. This is
     the investment action: spending a turn to make future turns more
     powerful. Requires specific resource payments.
   - MUSEUM CONTRIBUTION — Place specimens into the shared museum
     display. Museum rows and columns score based on completion,
     rewarding set collection across the table.

3. TURN ORDER PHASE — Adjust player order based on workers placed in
   the Turn Order area during the Action Phase.

4. REWARD PHASE — Receive benefits based on correspondence with the
   scientific community and progress toward the current Beagle goal.

5. CLEANUP PHASE — Prepare for the next round or proceed to final
   scoring after all five rounds.

### Key Design Patterns

WORKER PROGRESSION AS TRAINING INVESTMENT: The seal system is Darwin's
Journey's signature mechanic and one of the most elegant solutions to
the worker placement "sameness" problem. In most worker placement games,
all workers are functionally identical — an interchangeable unit that
occupies a space. Here, each worker is a distinct entity with a growing
portfolio of competencies. Placing a worker on the Study action to acquire
a navigation seal costs you an action NOW but permanently expands that
worker's capability for every future round. The design consequence is
profound: early rounds demand investment in training, creating a slow
start that pays exponential dividends. Players who rush to score without
training their workers find themselves locked out of the most powerful
action spaces by mid-game. The system also creates meaningful
differentiation between your workers — you might have a navigation
specialist, a correspondence expert, and a generalist — which produces
the kind of individual-unit attachment usually reserved for RPGs.

COMPETENCY GATING AS PROGRESSIVE COMPLEXITY: The seal requirements on
action spaces serve a dual function. Strategically, they force players
to plan their worker development paths rounds in advance. Experientially,
they create a natural difficulty curve within each game. Early action
spaces require one or two common seals — accessible to most workers by
round two. The most powerful spaces require three or four seals in
specific combinations, meaning only late-game workers with deliberate
training can access them. This is a self-pacing mechanism: new players
naturally gravitate toward simpler spaces while learning, and the game
does not punish them because powerful spaces are inaccessible anyway
until workers are trained. The seal system teaches the game while you
play it, without rules overhead or tutorial scaffolding.

GALAPAGOS EXPLORATION AS NETWORK BUILDING: The island map is a spatial
network where movement requires navigation capability and each location
offers unique specimens. Exploring a location places a token that
provides an immediate bonus and marks your presence for scoring. The
network structure means not all specimens are equally accessible — rare
species on remote islands require workers with advanced navigation seals
and multi-turn movement planning. This creates a geographic strategy
layer on top of the worker placement core: players must decide whether to
deeply explore a nearby cluster of islands or push toward distant,
high-value locations. The map also creates natural player interaction
because exploration tokens are limited — the first player to reach an
island claims its best rewards, incentivizing early investment in
navigation.

SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND MUSEUM DELIVERY: Specimens are gathered through
exploration and research actions -- players place Research tokens onto
matching Specimen icons on their personal boards. These specimens are
then delivered to the shared Museum display, earning coins and Theory
of Evolution track advancement based on the position of the Museum tile
within its row and column. The Museum's grid structure rewards strategic
placement: for each empty space in the row, you gain a coin, and for
each already-placed tile, you advance on the Theory of Evolution track.
Completing a museum row also triggers additional bonuses. Specimens
thus drive both immediate resource gains and long-term scoring through
the evolution track multiplier system, making the collection and
delivery pipeline one of the game's most rewarding strategic throughlines.

CORRESPONDENCE AS STAMP PLACEMENT: The correspondence system models
scientific communication as an area-majority mechanic. Players move
Stamps from their personal board stacks onto Envelope locations on the
main board. During the Reward Phase, the players with the most and
second-most Stamps on each Envelope earn that Envelope's bonus actions.
Depleting a Stamp stack from your personal board also triggers the
associated action printed beneath it. The system creates a long-term
strategic arc: managing your limited Stamp supply across multiple
Envelopes requires balancing immediate benefits (Stamp stack depletion
bonuses) against Reward Phase majority contests. Correspondence requires
specific Wax Seals on your worker, linking it to the training pipeline
and creating a cascading dependency: correspondence demands trained
workers, trained workers demand Academy investment, Academy investment
demands early-game tempo sacrifice.

MUSEUM CONTRIBUTIONS AS SHARED DISPLAY: The museum board is shared
across all players, creating a rare semi-cooperative element in a
competitive game. When any player completes a museum row or column,
everyone who contributed to it scores. This means contributing specimens
to the museum is both an investment (you score for completion) and a
gift to opponents (they also score). The design creates fascinating
calculus: do you complete a row knowing your opponent scores almost as
much as you? Do you block a column by withholding a specimen you could
contribute? The museum is also a information display — you can see what
opponents are collecting and infer their institutional correspondence
targets. The shared scoring surface transforms a competitive worker
placement game into something more nuanced, where cooperation and
competition coexist at the specimen level.

VOYAGE TRACK AS GEOGRAPHIC PROGRESSION: The Beagle's voyage track
serves triple duty: it unlocks new geographic regions on the map (making
previously inaccessible islands available for exploration), provides
immediate bonuses at each stop (resources, seals, specimens), and
determines turn order at round end. Advancing on the track requires
specific actions and resources, creating an investment decision:
pushing ahead on the voyage opens new opportunities but consumes actions
that could be spent exploring already-accessible islands. Players who
advance quickly get first access to remote island specimens and
favorable turn order; players who advance slowly can deeply exploit
nearby islands before moving on. The track ensures that every game
follows a natural geographic narrative — from the South American coast
through the archipelago — while allowing players to set their own pace
through that narrative.

ASYMMETRIC CHARACTER ABILITIES: Each player character offers a unique
starting configuration and ongoing ability that subtly biases their
strategic direction without dictating it. One character might start with
an extra navigation seal, nudging them toward early exploration. Another
might have a correspondence bonus, favoring institutional relationships.
The asymmetry is calibrated to suggest a strategy rather than enforce
one — every character can pursue every path, but each has a slight edge
in one direction. This light asymmetry is appropriate for the game's
weight: meaningful enough to create replayability, restrained enough
to avoid the overwhelming decision space of heavy asymmetric designs.

### What Makes It #87

Darwin's Journey demonstrates that worker placement can be a vehicle for
genuine thematic storytelling when the core mechanism — worker competency
progression — aligns perfectly with the subject matter. The seal system
is not a gimmick layered onto a standard design; it IS the design, and
everything else (exploration, collection, correspondence, the museum)
flows from the question of what your workers are capable of doing. At
3.59 weight, it occupies the sweet spot between accessible Euro and heavy
strategic game, offering deep cascading decisions (training leads to
exploration leads to collection leads to institutional scoring) without
the rules overhead of heavier designs. It is the rare game that teaches
you something about its historical subject through the act of playing it.
