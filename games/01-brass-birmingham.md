## Design Notes

Designer: Martin Wallace. Published by Roxley Games (2018).

### Theme Integration

Set during England's Industrial Revolution (1770-1870) in the West Midlands.
Players are competing entrepreneurs building industries and transportation
networks. The theme is not decorative — every mechanic maps to a real economic
concept. Coal must be physically transported along connected routes. Iron
doesn't need transport (historically moved in small volumes by horse and wagon).
Beer was safer than water in industrial settlements, so it lubricates commerce.
The rulebook includes historical bios of 8 real figures (Arkwright, Tinsley,
Brunel, Stephenson, Watt, Owen, Bessemer, Coade) — grounding the game in
actual history.

### Core Loop

Two eras (Canal 1770-1830, Rail 1830-1870), each played to deck exhaustion.
Per turn: 2 actions, each requiring a card discard. Six action types:

1. BUILD - Place industry tiles on the board (location-specific card required)
2. NETWORK - Place canal/rail links to expand your reach
3. DEVELOP - Skip lower-level industry tiles to access higher ones (costs iron)
4. SELL - Flip cotton mills, manufacturers, potteries by connecting to merchants
5. LOAN - Take 30 pounds, lose 3 income levels (never repaid — income penalty only)
6. SCOUT - Discard 3 cards total, gain 1 Wild Location + 1 Wild Industry card

Scoring happens at end of each era: link tiles score by adjacent connections,
flipped industry tiles score their VP value.

### Key Design Patterns

DUAL-USE CARDS: Every card serves as both a location identifier AND a resource
to discard for any action. This creates constant tension — do you use the card
for its location (Build action) or burn it for something else? Only Build
requires the specific card; all other actions accept any discard.

ERA RESET: At end of Canal Era, all Level 1 industries are removed from the
board. Level 2+ survive into Rail Era. This rewards early investment in
higher-level buildings and creates a natural mid-game pivot point. Canal links
are removed too — you rebuild your network with rail.

TURN ORDER AS RESOURCE: Money spent each round goes on your character tile on
the Turn Order Track. Whoever spent LEAST goes first next round. This creates
a deliberate tension between spending big (powerful actions) and going first
(positional advantage). Elegant because it uses existing game currency rather
than a separate mechanism.

SHARED RESOURCE INFRASTRUCTURE: Coal mines and iron works are owned by one
player but consumed by anyone connected to them. When the last resource is
taken, the tile flips (scoring for its owner). This means opponents can
inadvertently help you score. Beer works similarly — your breweries can be
consumed by opponents if connected. Shared infrastructure creates emergent
interaction without direct conflict.

MARKET PRICING: Coal and iron have dynamic markets on the board. As resources
are consumed from the market, prices rise. Building new mines/works pushes
cubes INTO the market (filling cheapest spaces first), driving prices down.
Supply and demand as a game mechanic.

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY MATTERS: Coal must be transported along connected routes
to reach the building that needs it. Your network isn't just for scoring —
it's the supply chain. Beer requires connection too (except from your own
breweries). Iron is the exception: no connection needed, simulating its
historical transport by wagon.

TECH TREE VIA PLAYER MAT: Industries are stacked on your player mat from
Level 1 (top) to highest level. You must build or develop through lower
levels to access higher ones. The Develop action lets you skip levels (at
iron cost), creating a strategic shortcut. Higher-level tiles score more VP
and provide more income, but cost more to build.

OVERBUILDING: You can replace your own industry tiles with higher-level ones
of the same type. You can even overbuild opponents' coal mines and iron works
— but ONLY when no resources of that type exist anywhere on the board or in
the market. This creates a fascinating endgame dynamic around resource scarcity.

LOAN DESIGN: Loans are permanent income reduction, not debt to repay. Taking
a loan is always available and provides immediate cash, but experienced players
often win with low or negative income. The rulebook tips explicitly say "do not
be afraid of taking loans" — the designers want players to treat income as a
resource to spend, not hoard.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 2/3/4 players: 10/9/8 rounds per era
- Location cards removed at lower player counts (color-coded banners)
- Merchant tiles removed at lower counts (fewer market connections)
- 2-player: Warrington and Nottingham get no merchants

### What Makes It #1

The interlocking systems. Every decision ripples: building a coal mine helps
opponents who are connected to it, but flipping it scores you points. Taking
a loan funds expansion but costs future income. Going cheap preserves turn
order but slows your engine. The card system forces adaptation — you can't
always build where you want, so you pivot constantly. The era reset prevents
runaway leaders and gives everyone a second act. There's no single dominant
strategy; the game rewards reading the board state and adapting.

Brass Birmingham is a masterclass in making economic simulation feel like
a game rather than a spreadsheet. The theme does real work.
