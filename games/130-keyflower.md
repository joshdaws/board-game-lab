### Theme Integration

Keyflower is set in a colonial-era settlement where players are village
founders competing to build the most prosperous community across four
seasons. Each season, new settlers arrive at the docks — represented
by workers in three colors (red, blue, yellow) plus the rare green —
and tiles representing buildings, workshops, and upgrades become
available for auction. The seasonal structure is not merely a round
counter; it models the annual rhythm of a developing settlement.
Spring brings the first settlers and basic infrastructure. Summer
expands the community with specialized buildings. Autumn introduces
advanced facilities and trade opportunities. Winter brings the final
wave of settlers and the scoring objectives that determine which
villages thrived and which merely survived.

The worker color system carries thematic weight beyond its mechanical
function. Different colored workers represent different settler
communities — each with its own skills and cultural identity. When
you bid on a tile or activate it, you commit to a specific worker
color, and that commitment is binding: once a red worker has been
used on a tile, only red workers can be used there for the rest of
the season. This models the historical reality that early settlements
were built by specific communities whose labor and expertise defined
a location's character. A mine worked by one community could not
seamlessly absorb workers from another without disruption. The color
commitment rule transforms worker assignment from a simple resource
expenditure into a strategic constraint that shapes every decision.

The village you build is physically constructed from the tiles you
win at auction, arranged in a personal tableau that represents your
settlement's layout. Resources must be transported between tiles
using movement rules that follow adjacency and road connections,
modeling the logistical reality that raw materials extracted at one
location must be physically moved to the workshop or building that
processes them. This spatial logistics layer means your village's
layout matters — a poorly organized settlement with resources far
from the buildings that need them is less efficient than one with
thoughtful infrastructure planning. The game asks you to think not
just about what to build but about where to build it.

### Core Loop

The game plays over exactly four rounds (seasons: Spring, Summer,
Autumn, Winter). Each season has three phases:

**PHASE 1 — TILE AUCTION AND WORKER PLACEMENT (Simultaneous)**

New tiles are revealed at the central dock area (the number depends
on player count). Starting with the first player and proceeding
clockwise, players take turns performing one of the following until
all players consecutively pass:

1. BID ON A TILE — Place one or more workers of the SAME COLOR next
   to a tile at the docks. Your bid must exceed any existing bid on
   that tile in worker count. If you are outbid, your workers return
   to your supply. Critical rule: once a color has been used to bid
   on a tile, all subsequent bids on that tile must use the same
   color.

2. ACTIVATE A TILE — Place one or more workers of the SAME COLOR
   directly on a tile (either at the docks or in any player's
   village, including your own) to use that tile's production or
   conversion ability. The more workers placed, the more times the
   ability activates. Same color commitment rule applies: once a
   color is used to activate a tile, only that color may activate
   it for the rest of the season.

3. PASS — Once you pass, you may not take further actions this
   season. When all players pass, the auction concludes.

**PHASE 2 — TILE ACQUISITION**

4. Each tile at the docks is won by the highest bidder. Winning
   bidders lose their bid workers (they go to the tile's previous
   owner or to the general supply for dock tiles). Each won tile is
   added to the winner's village, placed adjacent to existing tiles
   following placement rules. Unbid tiles are removed from the game.

5. All workers that were placed ON tiles for activation remain on
   those tiles — they are claimed by the tile's owner at the end
   of the season as new workers for their supply. This means
   activating an opponent's tile gives THEM workers.

**PHASE 3 — SEASON CLEANUP**

6. Collect all workers from your village tiles into your supply.
   These include workers placed by you and by opponents who
   activated your tiles.
7. Generate resources from any tiles that produce during cleanup.
8. Transport resources: move resources along connected tiles in your
   village (following road connections) to position them for future
   use or scoring.
9. Advance the season marker. In Winter, skip to final scoring.

**WINTER SCORING:** Each player reveals their Winter tiles (dealt
secretly at game start), which define end-game scoring objectives.
Players bid on and acquire Winter tiles normally, then score: tile
VP values, skill tile upgrades, resources on specific tiles, and
Winter objective bonuses. Gold (a special resource) is wild and
scores in any category.

### Key Design Patterns

DUAL-PURPOSE WORKERS AS CURRENCY AND LABOR: Keyflower's defining
innovation is that workers serve two completely distinct functions:
they are auction currency (spent to bid on tiles) and action
activators (placed on tiles to use abilities). This dual purpose
creates a fundamental resource tension — every worker spent bidding
is a worker that cannot activate a tile, and vice versa. The decision
to bid aggressively on a tile depletes the workforce you need to use
it. The decision to conserve workers for activation means you may
lose critical tiles at auction. This unified resource system creates
strategic depth from mechanical simplicity: one resource type
generates two distinct decision spaces.

COLOR COMMITMENT AS BINDING CONSTRAINT: Once a worker of a specific
color is placed on a tile (whether as a bid or for activation), all
future workers placed on that tile during that season must match
that color. This rule transforms worker color from a cosmetic
distinction into a strategic weapon. If you bid red on a tile and
your opponent has no red workers, they cannot contest it. If you
activate a tile with yellow workers, only yellow workers can activate
it further this season. Color commitment creates information warfare:
which colors your opponents hold is hidden, and bidding with a rare
color can lock others out. It also creates collection pressure —
you need diversity of worker colors to maintain flexibility, but
workers of any single color are needed in quantity to win contested
auctions.

ACTIVATING OPPONENT TILES AS ECONOMIC EXCHANGE: You may place workers
on any player's village tiles to activate them, but those workers
are collected by the tile's owner at season's end. This creates a
remarkable economic exchange: you gain the tile's production benefit,
but your opponent gains a worker for their supply. The cost of using
an opponent's tile is not abstract — you are literally giving them
a resource. This mechanism creates emergent negotiation dynamics
without explicit trading. Players must weigh whether the production
benefit of activating an opponent's tile exceeds the cost of
strengthening that opponent's worker supply. It also means that
building powerful tiles has an externality: opponents will use your
tiles, growing their own engine while feeding yours workers.

SEASONAL INFORMATION GRADIENT: The four-season structure creates a
natural information gradient. In Spring, players have minimal
information — they know their own starting workers and Winter tiles
but nothing about opponents' hidden resources. Each successive season
reveals more: auction bids expose worker colors and quantities,
tile activations reveal strategic priorities, and village layouts
show resource accumulation. By Autumn, experienced players can
reconstruct opponents' approximate positions and Winter scoring
potential. This gradient means early-game decisions are made under
uncertainty (requiring flexible strategies) while late-game decisions
are made with substantial information (allowing targeted play). The
Winter tiles — dealt at game start but scored at game end — create
a strategic through-line that informed players pursue from the first
season.

TRANSPORT LOGISTICS AS SPATIAL PUZZLE: Resources in Keyflower are not
abstract stockpiles; they sit on specific tiles in your village and
must be physically transported along road connections to reach tiles
where they are needed. This transport requirement transforms village
layout from an aesthetic choice into a logistical optimization
problem. Placing a resource-producing tile far from the tile that
consumes those resources creates inefficiency. Road connections
between tiles expand your transport network, and tiles with multiple
road connections serve as logistics hubs. The spatial puzzle adds a
dimension to tile acquisition that pure economic games lack: not
only must you evaluate a tile's production value, but you must also
evaluate where it fits in your village's physical layout.

WINTER TILES AS HIDDEN OBJECTIVES: Each player receives Winter tiles
at game start that define personal end-game scoring conditions.
These tiles are kept secret until Winter, when they are revealed
and bid on like normal tiles (you are not guaranteed to keep your
own Winter tiles). The hidden objectives create strategic asymmetry
without variable player powers — each player pursues a different
scoring path based on their Winter tiles, but the uncertainty about
opponents' objectives persists until the final round. The auction
mechanism for Winter tiles means that even your end-game scoring
conditions are contestable: an opponent who deduces your Winter
strategy can bid on your scoring tiles to deny you points or claim
them for their own village.

### What Makes It #130

Keyflower achieves something rare in game design: it unifies three
major mechanism families — auction, worker placement, and tile
laying — into a single coherent system where the same resource
(workers) drives all three. The color commitment rule adds a
layer of strategic constraint that prevents the game from collapsing
into pure economic optimization, and the transport logistics give
the tile-laying component genuine mechanical weight rather than
treating it as mere spatial arrangement. At 3.33 weight, it sits
in a sweet spot where every rule earns its complexity — nothing
feels bolted on or unnecessary. The game scales cleanly from 2 to
6 players, an unusually wide range for a game of this depth, and
the hidden Winter tiles ensure that no two games pursue identical
strategic trajectories. Keyflower is a designer's game in the best
sense: every mechanism justifies its existence, and the whole is
substantially greater than the sum of its parts.
