### Theme Integration

Dwellings of Eldervale is set in a mythic realm where eight elemental
realms — fire, ice, shadow, earth, air, water, lightning, and arcane —
converge around a central dragon's domain. Players are rival factions
sending workers to explore these realms, battle monsters, and establish
permanent dwellings. The fantasy theme is not merely decorative; it
provides the structural logic for why workers stay on the board rather
than returning to your supply. When you place a worker in a realm, they
are adventuring there — building a dwelling, confronting a monster,
harvesting elemental resources. The commitment is physical and permanent
until the worker is explicitly retrieved, modeling the idea that taming
a wild magical frontier requires sustained presence, not hit-and-run
exploitation.

Each elemental realm produces a distinct resource type tied to its
thematic identity, and the monsters that guard these realms are not
generic obstacles but gatekeepers whose defeat unlocks the region's
potential. The dragon in the center represents the ultimate prize and
threat — a contested zone where factions collide. Adventure cards,
which form each player's growing tableau, represent the magical
artifacts, creatures, and allies gathered during exploration. These
cards are thematically diverse but mechanically coherent: they feed
your engine, provide combat bonuses, and score end-game points. The
modular board means the map of Eldervale is different every game,
reinforcing the theme of exploring an unknown and shifting landscape
rather than a fixed geography.

The faction-specific player powers further embed theme into asymmetry.
Each faction has a unique ability that shapes how they interact with
the realm — some factions are combat-oriented, others are resource
specialists, and some excel at dwelling construction. This asymmetry
means the same board state presents different strategic landscapes to
different players, and the thematic identity of your faction genuinely
constrains and enables your strategic arc.

### Core Loop

The game plays over a variable number of rounds until a triggering
condition ends the game. On your turn, you perform exactly one of
two possible actions:

1. PLACE A WORKER — Take a worker from your supply and place it in
   any open adventure space on the modular board. Then resolve the
   following in order:
   a. Collect the adventure card from that space (if any) and add it
      to your tableau or hand. Adventure cards provide ongoing engine
      effects, immediate bonuses, or end-game scoring.
   b. Collect the resource associated with that realm's element.
   c. If a monster occupies the realm, you may battle it by rolling
      dice. Defeating the monster grants rewards and may allow you
      to place a dwelling in the realm.
   d. If other players' workers or dwellings are present, an area
      conflict may be triggered, resolved through dice combat
      modified by adventure card bonuses.
   e. If you have enough presence (workers and dwellings) in a realm,
      you may build a dwelling there, establishing permanent area
      majority and unlocking dwelling-specific bonuses.

2. RETRIEVE WORKERS — Take back all of your workers from the board
   to your supply. This is your only way to regain placed workers.
   When you retrieve, you activate the "regroup" effects of adventure
   cards in your tableau that trigger on retrieval, creating an engine
   pulse. You do NOT remove your dwellings — those remain permanently.

The game ends when a player places their final dwelling or when the
adventure card supply is exhausted. Final scoring combines area
majority in each realm, adventure card end-game bonuses, remaining
resources, and defeated monsters.

### Key Design Patterns

PERSISTENT WORKER PLACEMENT: Unlike traditional worker placement where
workers return each round, in Dwellings of Eldervale workers remain on
the board until you spend an entire turn retrieving them. This changes
the fundamental calculus of worker placement: every placement is a
commitment, not a temporary claim. Your workers accumulate on the board,
building presence in realms but depleting your available supply. The
retrieve action becomes a strategic reset — a turn spent not placing
but recouping, creating a natural rhythm of expansion and consolidation
that players must time carefully against opponents' plans.

DWELLING AS PERMANENT AREA CONTROL: Dwellings are structures that,
once placed, never leave the board. They contribute to area majority
scoring and provide ongoing benefits. Because dwellings are permanent,
they represent irreversible strategic commitments — choose the wrong
realm and you've locked resources into a losing position. The limited
number of dwellings per player (eight) means each placement narrows
your future options while strengthening your current position. This
creates a declining-flexibility arc where early decisions are broad
and exploratory while late decisions are constrained and consequential.

DICE COMBAT WITH MITIGATION: Monster battles and player conflicts use
dice, but the system layers significant mitigation through adventure
card bonuses, faction abilities, and tactical choices about when and
where to fight. The dice inject uncertainty that prevents pure
calculation from dominating the game, while the mitigation systems
ensure that investment in combat capability is reliably rewarded.
This balance keeps combat exciting without making it feel arbitrary —
a critical calibration for a game that mixes Eurogame engine building
with Ameritrash-style conflict.

TABLEAU ENGINE FROM ADVENTURE CARDS: Each adventure card you collect
adds a permanent capability to your tableau. Some cards trigger on
placement, others on retrieval, and others during scoring. As your
tableau grows, both your placement turns and your retrieval turns
become more powerful, creating an accelerating engine. The adventure
cards are spatially distributed across the modular board, so your
engine-building goals influence your spatial strategy — you need to
place workers where the cards you want are located, not just where
the resources or area-majority positions are optimal.

MODULAR BOARD AS REPLAYABILITY ENGINE: The eight elemental realm tiles
are arranged differently each game, changing adjacencies, monster
positions, and resource distributions. This prevents memorized openings
and forces players to evaluate the specific board state before
committing to a strategy. The modular board also means that certain
faction powers are stronger or weaker depending on the layout, adding
a layer of adaptive strategy at game start.

HYBRID GENRE DESIGN: Dwellings of Eldervale deliberately bridges the
Eurogame and Ameritrash traditions. The worker placement, engine
building, and area majority scoring are Euro mechanisms; the dice
combat, monster battles, and fantasy theme are Ameritrash mechanisms.
The design's achievement is making these traditions coexist without
either dominating — combat matters but doesn't override economic
efficiency, and engine optimization matters but doesn't make combat
irrelevant. This hybrid approach broadens the game's appeal across
player preferences and creates a strategic texture where multiple
paths to victory genuinely coexist.

### What Makes It #126

Dwellings of Eldervale earns its position by successfully merging two
traditions that many designers have attempted to combine but few have
balanced this effectively. The persistent worker placement mechanism
transforms a familiar Euro framework into something with genuine
spatial consequence, and the adventure card tableau gives every game
a different engine trajectory. The modular board prevents staleness
across repeated plays, and the faction asymmetry ensures that even
the same board configuration plays differently depending on which
powers are in the game. It is a maximalist design — big table
presence, dice, miniatures, engine building, area control — that
manages to keep its decision space coherent rather than sprawling.
