### Theme Integration

Tainted Grail reimagines the Arthurian legend not as chivalric romance but as dark
survival horror. The world of Avalon is dying. The standing stones --- Menhirs ---
that hold back an encroaching supernatural mist are flickering out, and the
landscape itself dissolves into nothingness when their light fails. This is not
the gleaming Camelot of popular imagination; it is a decaying, corrupted land where
the Round Table has fallen, the Grail quest has failed, and players are not
legendary heroes but desperate survivors trying to understand why their world is
collapsing. The dark Arthurian framing is essential to the mechanical experience:
the Menhir system creates genuine urgency that a lighter theme could not sustain,
and the branching narrative delivers moral dilemmas that require the weight of
mythological consequence to land emotionally.

The dual encounter system --- Diplomacy and Combat --- reflects the game's thematic
commitment to a world where violence is not the only or even the primary path
forward. Diplomacy encounters model conversations, negotiations, and social
manipulation through a separate card deck with its own symbols, combos, and
escalation mechanics. Combat encounters use a parallel system with different cards
and different resolution patterns. A character might negotiate with a corrupted
knight using charm and deception, or fight the same knight with sword and sorcery,
and the encounter system for each feels mechanically distinct. This duality models
a world where words and steel are equally valid tools, and character builds that
invest in one path sacrifice capability in the other.

The survival pressure --- managing food, health, and the relentless Menhir
degradation timer --- grounds the high fantasy in physical reality. Players are not
demigods striding across the landscape; they are hungry, wounded, and perpetually
short on time. Every detour to explore a ruin or investigate a mystery costs food
and risks the Menhirs going dark. This tension between curiosity and survival
is the game's emotional engine: the world is fascinating and horrifying in equal
measure, but engaging with it may cost you the resources needed to keep it from
disappearing entirely.

### Core Loop

Tainted Grail plays as a campaign across 15 chapters, each session spanning
approximately 60-120 minutes depending on player count and exploration choices.
Within each session, the turn structure operates as follows:

1. MENHIR PHASE --- At the start of each day (round), check all active Menhirs
   on the map. Each Menhir has a timer that counts down. When a Menhir's timer
   reaches zero, its light goes out and all map tiles connected solely through
   that Menhir become inaccessible --- they fade into the mist. Players must
   spend resources (energy fragments) to relight Menhirs before they expire.
   Managing the Menhir network is the game's overarching logistical challenge.

2. PLAYER TURNS --- Each player takes a full turn before the next player acts.
   On your turn, you may perform two actions from:
   - TRAVEL: Move to an adjacent revealed location on the map
   - EXPLORE: Reveal a new location tile adjacent to your current position,
     reading its discovery text from the exploration journal
   - ENCOUNTER: Engage with a character, creature, or situation at your
     location, triggering either a Diplomacy or Combat encounter
   - REST: Recover health or energy, spending food
   - INTERACT: Use location-specific abilities (trade, craft, gather resources)

3. ENCOUNTER RESOLUTION --- When a Diplomacy or Combat encounter is triggered,
   the player plays cards from their respective encounter deck. Each card has
   symbols that must be matched to thresholds on the encounter card. Diplomacy
   cards use social symbols (Empathy, Deceit, Aggression, Practicality). Combat
   cards use martial symbols (Attack, Defense, Special). Card combos chain
   together for enhanced effects. Failing an encounter typically results in
   health loss, resource penalties, or narrative consequences. Some encounters
   are optional; others are required to progress the story.

4. NARRATIVE PROGRESSION --- Key encounters and exploration discoveries advance
   the chapter's narrative, often presenting branching choices that affect future
   chapters. Choices are recorded in a tracking system that carries consequences
   forward through the campaign. Some branches are irreversible --- characters may
   die, locations may be permanently altered, and faction relationships may shift
   based on player decisions.

5. CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT --- Between encounters, players improve their characters
   by acquiring new cards for their Diplomacy and Combat decks, upgrading
   existing cards, and advancing stat tracks that provide passive bonuses. Deck
   composition evolves across the campaign, creating persistent character identity.

6. END OF DAY --- After all players have acted, advance Menhir timers, resolve
   event cards, and consume food. If any player has no food, they suffer health
   penalties. If any player's health reaches zero, they are knocked out and
   suffer campaign penalties.

### Key Design Patterns

MENHIR TIMER AS ENVIRONMENTAL PRESSURE: The Menhir system is Tainted Grail's
most distinctive mechanical contribution. Standing stones scattered across the
map have countdown timers that tick toward zero each round. When a Menhir goes
dark, the map tiles it illuminates become inaccessible --- effectively erased from
the game world. Players must detour to relight Menhirs using scarce resources,
creating a persistent logistical tension between exploration (moving forward to
discover new content) and maintenance (backtracking to keep the world from
shrinking). The Menhir system transforms the map from a static play surface into
a dynamic, contracting environment that forces constant triage decisions. Which
Menhirs do you prioritize? Which regions can you afford to lose? The mechanic
generates urgency that no narrative text could achieve alone --- the world is
literally disappearing around you.

DUAL ENCOUNTER DECKS AS CHARACTER IDENTITY: Maintaining separate card decks for
Diplomacy and Combat creates a character-building system where investment in one
domain comes at the opportunity cost of the other. A character with a powerful
Combat deck and a weak Diplomacy deck will find social encounters punishing but
martial encounters trivial. The dual-deck system forces players to specialize or
generalize, and in cooperative play, it encourages team composition planning ---
one player might focus on Diplomacy while another handles Combat. The two systems
use different symbols, different combo structures, and different escalation
patterns, ensuring that they feel mechanically distinct rather than reskinned
versions of the same resolution system.

BRANCHING NARRATIVE AS CONSEQUENCE ENGINE: The campaign's 15 chapters contain
branching story paths where player choices create divergent experiences. Unlike
games that offer cosmetic narrative branches (different flavor text, same
mechanical outcome), Tainted Grail ties narrative choices to mechanical
consequences: faction relationships change, resources become available or
unavailable, and certain encounters or locations may be permanently altered.
The consequence engine means that replaying the campaign produces genuinely
different experiences, not just different text. Moral choices carry weight
because they affect the game state, not just the story. A player who betrays
an ally gains an immediate advantage but loses access to that ally's assistance
in future chapters.

SURVIVAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: Food, health, and energy form a survival triangle
that constrains all other decisions. Food is consumed each day and required for
rest actions. Health is lost through failed encounters and environmental hazards.
Energy fragments are spent to relight Menhirs. None of these resources are
abundant, and all compete for the player's limited actions. The survival layer
prevents the common adventure game problem of consequence-free exploration ---
every tile you reveal, every encounter you attempt, and every detour you take
costs resources that may be needed later. The survival pressure also creates
emotional investment: when your character is starving, wounded, and watching the
last Menhir flicker, the narrative stakes feel real because the mechanical
stakes are real.

COOPERATIVE SCALING WITH SOLO SUPPORT: The game scales from 1 to 4 players with
adjustments to encounter difficulty, resource availability, and Menhir timer
speeds. The solo mode is not an afterthought but a primary design target ---
many campaign games struggle with solo play because cooperative decision-making
is their primary interaction, but Tainted Grail's narrative focus and personal
character progression make the solo experience feel complete rather than diminished.
The cooperative mode adds coordination challenges (who relights which Menhir, who
handles which encounter type) that solo play replaces with multi-character
management.

DECK BUILDING AS CHARACTER PROGRESSION: Rather than using a traditional RPG
level-up system, character advancement occurs through acquiring and upgrading
cards in the Diplomacy and Combat decks. This approach ties progression directly
to gameplay --- every new card changes how encounters play out, and every upgrade
decision shapes the character's mechanical identity. The deckbuilding progression
also creates a satisfying arc where early encounters feel desperate (thin decks,
weak combos) and late encounters feel powerful (thick decks, reliable combos),
mirroring the narrative arc of survivors growing into heroes.

### What Makes It #133

Tainted Grail succeeds by solving the fundamental problem of narrative campaign
games: how to make the story feel consequential without reducing gameplay to
a choose-your-own-adventure book with dice. The Menhir system provides constant
mechanical tension that grounds the narrative in genuine resource pressure. The
dual encounter system gives players meaningful character differentiation without
traditional class restrictions. The branching narrative delivers consequences
that reshape the game world rather than merely changing flavor text. And the
survival layer ensures that every choice --- explore this ruin, fight this creature,
help this stranger --- carries a real cost in food, health, or time. The result
is a campaign experience that earns its 60-120 minute sessions through mechanical
engagement rather than just narrative curiosity. At weight 3.37, it sits in the
sweet spot between the accessibility of lighter narrative games and the mechanical
depth that sustains interest across a 15-chapter campaign.
