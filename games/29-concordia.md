## Design Notes

Designer: Mac Gerdts. Published by PD-Verlag / Rio Grande Games (2013).

### Theme Integration

Roman mercantile expansion across the Mediterranean — and unlike many
Eurogames where the theme is wallpaper, Concordia's Roman setting does
real structural work. Players are patrician families sending colonists
along land and sea routes to establish trade houses in cities that produce
goods: brick, food, tools, wine, and cloth. The five goods map loosely to
historical Roman commerce — brick for construction, food for sustenance,
wine and cloth as luxury exports, tools for industry. The personality
cards (Tribune, Architect, Prefect, etc.) carry Roman administrative
titles and their mechanical functions align with their thematic roles: the
Architect builds, the Prefect governs provincial production, the Colonist
mobilizes people, the Mercator trades with foreign markets. The gods that
determine endgame scoring — Vesta, Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury, Mars,
Minerva — each reward a different axis of achievement, evoking the Roman
practice of dedicating one's accomplishments to patron deities. Gerdts
makes the theme functional rather than decorative: you are not just
placing cubes on a map, you are building a trade network and currying
divine favor through your commercial accomplishments.

### Core Loop

The game plays over a variable number of rounds until one of two
conditions is met: all personality cards are purchased from the display,
or one player places their last house on the board. Each turn is
elemental: play ONE card from your hand, execute its action.

The seven core personality cards:

1. TRIBUNE — Recover all previously played cards back to hand. Optionally
   pay to recruit a new colonist. This is the "refresh" action — without
   it, you run out of cards to play.
2. ARCHITECT — Move your colonists along routes, then build houses in
   cities where your colonists stand. Building costs resources matching
   the city's type and the number of houses already present.
3. PREFECT — Either produce goods in a province (all players with houses
   there receive matching resources) OR collect the accumulated money
   bonus from all provinces that have already produced this cycle.
4. COLONIST — Place new colonists on the board from your supply, or
   collect money proportional to your total colonists.
5. MERCATOR — Trade goods with the bank: buy and/or sell at fixed prices,
   with one free trade and subsequent trades costing 1 sestertius each.
6. SENATOR — Purchase up to 2 personality cards from the display, paying
   their listed cost.
7. CONSUL — Purchase 1 personality card at a reduced cost.
8. DIPLOMAT — Copy the top card of any other player's discard pile,
   executing that card's action.

No in-game scoring occurs. All victory points are calculated at game end
through the god-scoring system on your accumulated personality cards.

### Key Design Patterns

PLAY-REFRESH RHYTHM: The defining structural pattern. You start with a
hand of seven cards and play one per turn, building up a discard pile of
used cards. When you play Tribune, you recover everything. This creates a
natural cadence: plan a sequence of actions, execute them over several
turns, then refresh. The key tension is WHEN to refresh. Play too few
cards before recovering and you waste tempo. Play down to your last card
and you telegraph the forced Tribune, letting opponents plan around you.
The rhythm also creates implicit round structure in a game with no formal
rounds — each play-recover cycle is its own strategic arc. Gerdts
eliminates the need for round markers, phase trackers, or income steps by
encoding all of it in the card-recovery mechanic.

CARDS AS BOTH ACTIONS AND SCORING: The central elegance. Every
personality card you purchase from the display serves two simultaneous
purposes — it adds an action to your repertoire AND a god-scoring lens to
your endgame calculation. A Jupiter card lets you take the associated
action during play but also scores you 1 point per non-brick house at
game end. A Mars card adds military utility and scores per colonist on
the board. This dual function means every purchase decision is both
tactical (what action do I need now?) and strategic (what scoring category
am I investing in?). There is no separation between engine-building and
point-accumulation — they are the same decision. This eliminates the
common Eurogame problem of "engine vs. points" timing, because building
your engine IS accumulating points.

HIDDEN SCORING THROUGH THE GODS: There is no score track. No points are
awarded during play. All scoring happens at game end, when each player
counts their personality cards by god type and multiplies against their
board state. Vesta scores money and goods remaining. Jupiter scores
non-brick houses built. Saturn scores the number of distinct provinces
where you have houses. Mercury scores the number of distinct goods types
your houses can produce. Mars scores colonists on the map. Minerva scores
sets of specialist cards matching specific goods types. The opacity is
deliberate — it prevents players from precisely calculating who is
winning, maintaining tension until the final count. It also rewards
balanced play: a player who invests heavily in one god may be readable,
while a player diversifying across scoring categories keeps opponents
guessing.

NO RANDOMNESS AFTER SETUP: Once the board is seeded with initial goods
tokens and the personality card display is dealt, every piece of
information is open and every outcome is deterministic. No dice, no card
draws during play, no event decks. The only card acquisition is deliberate
purchasing from a face-up display. This makes Concordia a pure strategy
game within a low-weight rules framework — a rare combination. The
determinism means every suboptimal outcome is traceable to a player
decision, not luck. Gerdts achieves strategic depth through player
interaction and positional complexity rather than randomness.

SHARED PRODUCTION VIA THE PREFECT: When a Prefect activates a province,
ALL players with houses in that province receive goods. The acting player
does not exclusively benefit. This creates a subtle cooperative tension —
you want to produce in provinces where you have houses, but doing so may
also feed your opponents. Timing your Prefect to maximize your own output
while minimizing opponents' gains (or forcing them to rely on your
production timing) is a core interactive element. The alternative Prefect
action — collecting money bonuses from already-produced provinces — adds
further timing complexity: do you produce now or wait to sweep up the
accumulated money bonuses?

DECK GROWTH AS STRATEGIC TRAJECTORY: You begin with seven identical cards
(every player starts with the same hand). Over the course of the game,
you purchase personality cards that expand your deck to perhaps 12-16
cards. Each purchased card both specializes your action economy (more
Architect cards mean more building actions per cycle) and commits you to
a scoring trajectory (more Jupiter cards mean you need non-brick houses
to score well). The deck-growth mechanic creates emergent strategic
identity — by mid-game, every player's deck tells a story about their
strategy. Importantly, the deck never shuffles or draws randomly; you
always have full knowledge of and control over your hand composition.

THE DIPLOMAT AS INDIRECT INTERACTION: The Diplomat card lets you copy
the top card of any opponent's discard pile. This creates interaction
without conflict — you benefit from opponents' strategic choices without
attacking them. It also introduces a reading element: watching what
opponents play and when they play Tribune (which resets their discard
pile) matters because it determines what the Diplomat can copy. An
opponent who just played Architect makes that action available to you
via Diplomat. This creates a layer of awareness about opponents' timing
and card sequencing that goes beyond simple blocking.

ESCALATING BUILDING COSTS: Multiple players can build houses in the same
city, but each subsequent house costs more (the base resource cost plus
additional resources for each house already present). First movers get
cheap positions; late arrivals pay a premium. This graduated pricing
creates a land-rush dynamic without explicit area control — early
expansion is rewarded not by exclusive ownership but by cost advantage.
It also ensures that blocking is never absolute: you can always build
somewhere, it just costs more. The escalation is gentle enough to
preserve strategic flexibility while still rewarding initiative.

MINIMAL RULES, MAXIMAL DEPTH: Concordia's full rules can be taught in
15 minutes. Play one card, do what it says. Seven card types. Five goods.
Build houses, produce resources, buy cards. No special phases, no upkeep,
no maintenance. Yet the strategic depth rivals games with three times its
rules overhead. Gerdts achieves this compression by loading all
complexity into the interaction between simple systems — card sequencing,
spatial positioning, production timing, and scoring diversification
create emergent depth without mechanical weight. The weight rating of
3.04 significantly understates the game's strategic ceiling.

### What Makes It #29

The ratio of rules elegance to strategic depth. Concordia is arguably the
most efficiently designed game in the top 50 — every rule does double or
triple duty, every component serves multiple functions, and no mechanism
exists purely for thematic decoration or mechanical busywork. The card
system alone collapses action selection, deck building, turn structure,
and scoring into a single unified mechanism. Gerdts — known for the
rondel in games like Antike, Imperial, and Navegador — proves with
Concordia that his design instinct runs deeper than any single mechanism.
The card-play system achieves the same constrained-choice tension as a
rondel (you can only do what your hand allows) while adding the
deck-growth dimension (your choice space expands as you buy cards).

The hidden scoring system is the secret weapon. In most Eurogames, the
final 30% of the game feels predetermined — the leader is visible and
the trailing players know they are behind. Concordia inverts this. The
absence of a score track means every game ends with genuine surprise,
and the multiplier-based god scoring means a player who looks weak in
one dimension may be quietly stacking scoring lenses in another. The
game rewards players who can hold a strategic plan in their head across
30-40 turns without external confirmation of their position.

The determinism is what keeps experienced players returning. With no
randomness after setup, every game of Concordia is a pure test of
planning, timing, and opponent-reading. Losses are instructive rather
than frustrating — you can trace exactly where your sequencing or
positioning fell short. It is a designer's game in the purest sense:
a system where every piece interlocks, nothing is wasted, and the
complexity lives in the players rather than the rules.
