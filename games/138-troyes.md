### Theme Integration

Troyes is set in the medieval French city of Troyes across four centuries of
development (1200-1600), where players represent influential families competing
to shape the city's growth through religious, civil, and military institutions.
The three colored dice --- white (religious), red (military), and yellow
(civil) --- represent the three pillars of medieval society, and each player's
dice pool is determined by how many citizens they have placed in each district.
This creates an immediate thematic coherence: a family heavily invested in the
cathedral has more religious influence (white dice), while one controlling the
city hall commands more civil power (yellow dice). The interplay between these
three societal spheres drives both the theme and the mechanics, modeling how
medieval power was never monolithic but always a negotiation between church,
state, and military authority.

The game's most distinctive thematic mechanism is the ability to purchase
opponents' dice. In medieval Troyes, families did not operate in isolation ---
they leveraged each other's resources through marriage alliances, commercial
partnerships, and political deals. When you buy an opponent's red die, you are
not stealing their military; you are hiring their soldiers, contracting their
mercenaries, or leveraging their political connections. The purchased dice
become unavailable to their owner for that round, creating a transaction that
is simultaneously cooperative (both parties benefit economically from the
purchase) and competitive (the buyer gains a capability the seller loses).
This mechanism transforms what could be a parallel optimization puzzle into a
deeply interactive negotiation game where your opponents' resources are always
partially available to you --- at a price.

Events drawn each round represent historical threats to the city: raids,
plagues, heresies, and political upheavals. Players collectively combat these
events by assigning dice to them, reducing their severity. Unresolved events
penalize all players, creating a tragedy-of-the-commons dynamic: everyone
benefits from event resolution, but spending dice on events means fewer dice
for personal advancement. The historical events ground the game's decisions in
a tangible context --- you are not abstractly optimizing resources but
defending your city from recognizable medieval dangers while simultaneously
trying to advance your family's influence.

### Core Loop

The game plays over six rounds. Each round follows this structure:

1. INCOME AND EVENTS --- Players collect income based on their position on the
   influence track and the citizens they have placed. A new event card is
   drawn from the event deck and placed on the board, adding its threat to
   any previously unresolved events. Events accumulate if not addressed,
   creating escalating pressure.

2. DICE ROLLING --- Each player rolls dice matching their citizens placed in
   the three districts. Citizens in the Cathedral produce white dice, citizens
   in the City Hall produce yellow dice, and citizens in the Palace produce
   red dice. Dice are rolled and placed in their respective district areas
   on the board, visible to all players. Any unassigned citizens in the
   general workforce area produce no dice.

3. PLAYER TURNS --- In turn order, players take turns performing one action
   at a time until all players pass. On each turn, a player selects a group
   of 1-3 dice of the same color and uses them to activate one of the
   available activity cards, combat an event, or place a citizen. Key rules:
   - You may freely use your own dice at no cost.
   - You may BUY one or more of an opponent's dice by paying that opponent
     coins (2 coins per die purchased). Purchased dice are removed from
     the opponent's available pool for the round.
   - Dice groups are combined by summing their values. Activity cards have
     minimum value thresholds and provide effects scaled to the dice total.
   - Activity cards are displayed in three rows (white, red, yellow)
     matching the die color required to activate them, though purchased
     dice of any color can be used on any activity with a cost penalty.
   - Players may also spend dice to combat events (reducing event severity)
     or to place new citizens into districts (expanding future dice pools).

4. EVENT RESOLUTION --- Any events whose threat level has not been fully
   reduced impose penalties on all players (lost victory points, lost
   citizens, lost resources). Events resolved through player dice
   investment are removed.

5. END OF ROUND --- Refill activity card slots, advance the round marker,
   and reset for the next round. After round 6, reveal hidden objective
   cards and perform final scoring.

Final scoring: points earned during the game from activity cards and event
combat, plus points from citizen placement on the Cathedral (under
construction throughout the game), plus hidden objective card scoring.
Each player has one secret objective card drawn at game start that scores
based on specific conditions (most citizens in a district, most of a
resource type, etc.). All players score all objective cards, but only the
conditions they have met --- meaning objectives are shared scoring
opportunities, not exclusive advantages.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE PURCHASING AS CORE INTERACTION: The ability to buy opponents' dice is
Troyes' defining innovation and the mechanism that elevates it above other
dice-based Euro games. For 2 coins per die, any player can purchase any
other player's available dice and use them as their own. The purchased dice
are removed from the seller's pool, making this a zero-sum transaction
modulated by the coin payment. This creates a rich strategic layer: players
with strong dice become targets for purchase, incentivizing them to use
high-value dice early before opponents can buy them. Players with weak rolls
can compensate by purchasing better dice from opponents. The mechanic also
generates implicit negotiation --- buying someone's dice helps you but also
gives them income, so the transaction has complex incentive structures. In
practice, the dice-buying mechanism ensures that no player is ever
eliminated by bad rolls, because the dice market provides alternatives.

THREE-COLOR DICE AS INSTITUTIONAL IDENTITY: The white/red/yellow dice
system maps to religious/military/civil institutions, and each color unlocks
different categories of activity cards. White dice activate religious
activities (typically providing influence and Cathedral construction points),
red dice activate military activities (typically combating events and
removing threats), and yellow dice activate civil activities (typically
generating income and resources). This color-coding creates natural
strategic specialization: a player who loads citizens into the Cathedral
has more white dice and gravitates toward religious activities. But
because dice can be purchased across color lines, specialization is never
absolute. A military-focused player can buy white dice to access religious
activities, paying a premium for flexibility. The three-color system
provides strategic direction without strategic imprisonment.

HIDDEN OBJECTIVE CARDS AS SHARED SCORING: Each player draws one hidden
objective card at game start, but the scoring rule is unusual: at game
end, ALL objective cards from ALL players are revealed, and every player
scores every objective they qualify for. This means your secret objective
also benefits opponents who happen to meet its conditions. The design
implication is subtle but significant: you cannot rely on your objective
card for exclusive advantage, only for informational advantage. You know
which condition will score and can optimize for it, but opponents may
stumble into qualifying without knowing. This prevents objective cards
from feeling like predetermined strategic rails while still providing
asymmetric starting information that guides early decisions.

EVENT COMBAT AS COLLECTIVE ACTION PROBLEM: Events threaten all players
equally, and any player can spend dice to reduce event severity. But dice
spent on events are dice not spent on personal advancement. This creates
a classic free-rider problem: every player benefits from event resolution
but would prefer someone else to bear the cost. The penalty for unresolved
events --- lost points, citizens, and resources --- is distributed equally,
so the rational self-interested play is to let others handle events. In
practice, the game solves this through the red die specialization: military-
focused players often find event combat more efficient because their red
dice are suited to it, creating a natural division of labor that emerges
from strategic choices rather than enforced cooperation.

CITIZEN PLACEMENT AS DICE INVESTMENT: Players expand their dice pools by
spending dice to place new citizens into districts. This creates a classic
investment-vs-exploitation tradeoff: dice spent placing citizens reduce
current-round productivity but increase future-round capacity. Placing a
citizen in the Cathedral means one more white die in subsequent rounds;
placing one in the Palace means one more red die. The timing of citizen
placement is critical --- early investment compounds across more rounds but
weakens early-game output, while late investment provides less compounding
benefit. Citizens can also be lost to events, meaning the investment carries
risk. This mechanism ensures that the game's dice economy grows organically
through player decisions rather than through automatic escalation.

ACTIVITY CARD VARIABLE SETUP: The activity cards available each game are
drawn from a larger pool, creating different strategic landscapes across
plays. Some cards reward dice manipulation (rerolling, value modification),
others reward specific resource accumulation, others provide direct points.
The variable setup means optimal strategy shifts each game based on which
cards appear, preventing solved or scripted play. Combined with the hidden
objective cards and the variable event deck, the setup variability ensures
that Troyes rewards adaptive strategy over memorized sequences, and that
each game presents a unique optimization landscape even for experienced
players.

INFLUENCE TRACK AS MULTI-USE CURRENCY: The influence track serves
simultaneously as a turn order mechanism, an income source, and a
tie-breaking resource. Advancing on the influence track costs resources
but provides ongoing benefits across all three dimensions. This multi-
functional design means that influence investment is never wasted but also
never sufficient on its own --- it supports a strategy without defining one.
Players who neglect influence lose income and turn priority; players who
over-invest in influence divert resources from dice-powered activities.
The influence track acts as a strategic thermostat, rewarding balanced
investment without mandating a specific level of commitment.

### What Makes It #138

Troyes' dice-purchasing mechanism remains one of the most elegant solutions
to the fundamental problem of dice-based strategy games: how do you preserve
the excitement of dice rolling while ensuring that skill, not luck, determines
outcomes? By making all players' dice available on a shared market, Troyes
transforms bad rolls from frustrating setbacks into purchasing opportunities
and transforms good rolls from automatic advantages into valuable commodities
that opponents will attempt to buy. The three-color institutional system
provides strategic direction without rigidity. The hidden objective scoring
rule prevents dominant strategies by ensuring that objectives benefit all
qualifying players. And the event system creates genuine cooperative pressure
within a competitive framework. At weight 3.38, Troyes demands strategic
planning and tactical adaptation in equal measure, rewarding players who can
read the dice market, time their purchases, and balance personal advancement
against collective threat management. Its lasting influence is visible in every
subsequent game that treats dice as tradeable resources rather than private
random outcomes.
