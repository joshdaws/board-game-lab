## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Pax Pamir: Second Edition is set during the Great Game of 19th century Afghanistan,
a period when Afghan tribal leaders navigated the competing imperial ambitions of
Britain and Russia while pursuing Afghan self-determination. The game does not cast
players as empire builders or colonial administrators. Instead, players are Afghan
political leaders — members of the local elite who court foreign powers not out of
loyalty but out of pragmatic self-interest. This framing is essential to the game's
identity: loyalty is a tool, not a commitment. A player who supports the British
coalition in one turn may switch to the Russian coalition the next, not because of
betrayal in a moral sense but because the political landscape has shifted and survival
demands adaptation. The game makes this thematic argument mechanically — there is no
penalty for switching loyalty beyond the cost of the card that enables it.

The cloth map, resin blocks, and metal coins are not merely production choices but
design signals. The map is sparse and abstracted — Afghanistan is represented as a
handful of regions connected by borders, with no terrain detail or resource hexes.
This abstraction communicates that the game is about political influence, not
geographic control. Armies and roads placed on the map are not yours; they belong to
the coalition you currently support. When you switch loyalty, those pieces remain
behind, now potentially serving another player who shares your former allegiance. The
physicality of the game — the way cards fan out in your court like a political
tableau, the way the market row sits between players like a shared intelligence
briefing — reinforces the theme of information, negotiation, and opportunism that
defined the historical Great Game.

The card market itself is thematically resonant. Cards enter from the right at a
low price and slide leftward as newer cards push them, eventually cycling off the
market entirely. Each card represents a historical figure, tribe, or event, and
purchasing one means bringing that actor into your court — your personal political
network. The market represents the shifting cast of characters available in the
Afghan political landscape at any moment, and the urgency of acquiring a card
before it disappears mirrors the fleeting nature of political alliances.

### Core Loop

On each turn, a player takes two actions from the following options:

1. PURCHASE - Buy a card from the six-card market row. Cards on the left cost more
   (up to 4 rupees plus loyalty cost) while the rightmost cards cost less or are
   free. Purchased cards are placed face-up in your court (personal tableau).
2. PLAY - Play a card from your hand into your court. Some cards have immediate
   effects when played (such as placing armies, roads, or tribes on the map).
3. CARD ACTIONS - Use an action printed on a card already in your court. Each card
   offers one or two actions from a menu of possibilities:
   a) TAX - Collect rupees from the market or from players with cards matching a
      region you influence.
   b) GIFT - Pay rupees to place a gift (cylinder) on a card, which counts toward
      your influence and acts as insurance against the card being removed.
   c) BUILD - Place a road, army, or tribe block belonging to your current coalition
      onto the map.
   d) MOVE - Relocate armies or spies on the map.
   e) BETRAY - Remove another player's card from their court if you have a spy on
      the same card. The betrayed card is discarded.
   f) BATTLE - Initiate combat in a region, removing opponent coalition blocks.
4. CHANGE LOYALTY - Discard all cards in your court without gifts, pay 2 rupees,
   and switch your loyalty to a different coalition (British, Russian, or Afghan).

After taking two actions, the active player checks whether a Dominance Check is
triggered. Four Dominance Check cards are shuffled into the deck; when one is
purchased, a scoring evaluation occurs. The coalition with the most combined
blocks (armies, roads, tribes) on the map is checked — if it has enough pieces
to be "dominant," players loyal to that coalition score victory points based on
their relative influence (gifts placed, prizes held, and patriots in court). If
no coalition is dominant, the game scores based on number of cylinders placed on
the board. After four Dominance Checks, the game ends.

### Key Design Patterns

LOYALTY AS MUTABLE IDENTITY: The defining innovation of Pax Pamir is that player
identity — which side you are on — is not fixed at the start of the game. Players
choose a coalition loyalty (British, Russian, or Afghan) and may change it at any
point by paying a cost. This transforms the game from a traditional area-majority
contest into something more fluid and politically charged. Because your scoring
is tied to your coalition's success, switching loyalty is not merely cosmetic — it
redefines your win condition mid-game. A player who has been building Russian
influence may suddenly switch to Afghan loyalty when they see that Russia cannot
achieve dominance before the next scoring check. This mechanic makes alliances
genuinely unstable, mirrors the historical reality of Afghan political flexibility,
and creates a game where reading the table — predicting who will stay loyal and
who will defect — is as important as optimizing your own position.

MARKET ROW AS SHARED INTELLIGENCE: The six-card market is fully visible to all
players, and every card purchased from it reveals the buyer's strategic intentions.
Buying a military card signals aggression; buying a card aligned with a particular
coalition hints at loyalty. The market's pricing structure — cheaper on the right,
more expensive on the left — creates timing pressure. A powerful card entering the
market on the right will be snapped up quickly unless players are cash-poor or
distracted. The market also serves as the game's clock: as cards cycle through the
market and into players' courts, the deck depletes, and Dominance Check cards
approach. Players who watch the market carefully can anticipate scoring rounds and
time their loyalty switches accordingly. The market is not a shop — it is a shared
information space that drives negotiation and bluffing.

DOMINANCE CHECKS AS SCORING PULSES: Rather than accumulating victory points
throughout the game, Pax Pamir scores in discrete bursts when Dominance Check cards
are purchased from the market. This design choice has profound strategic
implications. First, it rewards timing over accumulation — what matters is your
position at the moment of scoring, not your cumulative effort. Second, it creates
natural dramatic arcs: the approach of a Dominance Check intensifies tension as
players jockey for position, and the aftermath resets the political landscape.
Third, because any player can choose to purchase a Dominance Check card (and thus
trigger scoring), the timing of scoring is itself a contested strategic decision.
A player in a strong position wants to trigger scoring immediately; a player in a
weak position wants to delay it by denying the purchase. This makes the scoring
mechanism an active part of gameplay rather than a passive bookkeeping exercise.

MAP AS EMERGENT TABLEAU: The map in Pax Pamir is not pre-populated with resources
or fixed control markers. It begins largely empty and is built up through card play
— armies, roads, and tribes are placed when specific cards are played or their
actions are used. This means the map's strategic terrain is emergent: which regions
matter depends on which cards have been purchased and played. A region with no
coalition presence is irrelevant; a region where three coalitions have armies
becomes a flashpoint. Because coalition blocks belong to the coalition rather than
to the player who placed them, the map reflects collective political investments
rather than individual territorial claims. This creates situations where a player
may strengthen a coalition's map presence only to have a rival who shares that
loyalty benefit more from the effort.

BETRAYAL AS LEGITIMATE STRATEGY: The Betray action allows a player with a spy on
an opponent's court card to remove that card entirely. This is devastating — it
strips the opponent of an action ability, potentially removes their influence in
a region, and discards a card they invested resources to acquire. Crucially, Betray
is not an emergency mechanism or a rare event; it is a standard action available
whenever the prerequisite (a spy on the target card) is met. The game normalizes
political sabotage as a routine tool of statecraft rather than an exceptional act
of villainy. The spy prerequisite means Betrayal is telegraphed — opponents can
see when they are vulnerable — which creates a secondary game of spy placement and
court protection. Players must balance expanding their court (more actions, more
influence) against the vulnerability of having more targets for betrayal.

COURT AS PERSONAL POLITICAL NETWORK: Each player's court — the tableau of
face-up cards in front of them — represents their political network. Cards in court
provide action abilities, contribute to influence during Dominance Checks, and
define the player's political reach. But courts are vulnerable: cards can be
betrayed by rivals, and switching loyalty requires discarding unprotected cards.
The gift mechanism (placing cylinders on cards) serves as insurance — gifted cards
survive loyalty changes and are harder to betray. Managing your court is a constant
exercise in balancing breadth (more cards, more options) against depth (protecting
key cards with gifts). A wide, unprotected court is powerful but fragile; a narrow,
heavily gifted court is resilient but inflexible.

COALITION BLOCKS AS SHARED ASSETS: Armies, roads, and tribes placed on the map
belong to the coalition, not to the player who placed them. This is a radical
departure from most area-majority games, where territorial markers are personal
property. The shared-asset design means that building up a coalition's map presence
is inherently cooperative — any player loyal to that coalition benefits — but the
rewards are distributed unequally based on individual influence. This creates a
classic free-rider problem: every player wants their coalition to dominate, but no
one wants to invest disproportionately when others might reap the rewards. The
result is a subtle negotiation over burden-sharing that plays out through actions
rather than explicit deal-making.

WAKHAN SOLO OPPONENT: The solo mode features Wakhan, an AI opponent driven by a
priority card system that mimics the opportunistic decision-making of a human
player. Rather than following a deterministic flowchart, Wakhan evaluates the
game state and selects actions based on shifting priorities. This design
demonstrates that the game's core — loyalty switching, market reading, and
political opportunism — can be modeled procedurally, suggesting that its mechanics
capture genuine decision-making patterns rather than arbitrary game-mechanical
interactions.

### What Makes It #51

Pax Pamir: Second Edition is a game about the instability of alliances, and it
achieves this not through negotiation rules or trading mechanics but through the
deeper structural choice of making loyalty itself a mutable game state. Every other
competitive game assumes you are playing for yourself; Pax Pamir asks you to play
for a coalition whose membership is voluntary and whose composition changes
constantly. The result is a game where the most important information is not on the
board but in the minds of your opponents — who are they loyal to, and how long will
that last? The market row, the Dominance Checks, the spy-and-betray system, and the
shared coalition blocks all reinforce this central anxiety. It is a game that makes
political uncertainty feel thrilling rather than frustrating, and it does so with
a remarkably lean mechanical footprint. Wehrle's achievement is designing a game
where the theme of Great Game geopolitics is not layered onto abstract mechanics
but is the mechanics themselves.
