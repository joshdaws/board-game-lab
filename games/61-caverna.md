## Design Notes

Designer: Uwe Rosenberg. Published by Lookout Games (2013).

### Theme Integration

Caverna positions players as dwarven families carving out a living from the
mountainside, and the dual-nature of these dwarves -- half farmer, half miner --
is the game's structural thesis. Where Agricola confined players to pastoral
farmland, Caverna splits each player board into two halves: the forest exterior
(which clears into pastures and fields) and the mountain interior (which mines
into tunnels and caverns). This spatial bifurcation is not cosmetic. Forest
tiles produce food and animals through agricultural infrastructure; cave tiles
produce ore, rubies, and furnishing bonuses through subterranean development.
The dwarven theme justifies why a farming game has dungeon exploration, weapon
forging, and expedition quests -- these are industrious mountain folk who farm
by day and delve by night.

The expedition mechanic deepens the thematic commitment. Armed dwarves venture
out on quests, returning with resources, animals, or furnishing tiles. This is
Rosenberg's answer to the criticism that Agricola was too constrained -- Caverna
dwarves are adventurers as well as farmers, and the weapon-forging system gives
players an alternative economic engine that bypasses traditional agricultural
development entirely. The world-building is functional rather than narrative:
every thematic element creates a distinct mechanical pathway, and the dwarven
fantasy framing gives permission for a broader sandbox than pastoral realism
would allow.

Animals in Caverna are deeply integrated into the spatial puzzle. Dogs herd
sheep in pastures, donkeys live in mines to carry ore, and each animal type
requires specific housing infrastructure. The thematic logic -- dogs on
pastures, donkeys in tunnels -- maps cleanly onto mechanical constraints,
making the animal husbandry rules intuitive despite their complexity. Breeding
happens automatically during harvest, and the constraint is always housing, not
acquisition. The theme says: you are building a home for a growing family and
their livestock, and every room and pasture you construct is an investment in
that domestic expansion.

### Core Loop

The game plays over 12 rounds, grouped into stages that progressively reveal
new action spaces. Each round follows this structure:

1. REPLENISH - Add resources to accumulating action spaces. New action spaces
   are revealed according to the current round (one per round). Accumulated
   resources on unchosen spaces grow each round, creating escalating incentives.
2. WORK PHASE - Starting with the first player, each player places one dwarf
   (worker) on an available action space and immediately resolves it. Continue
   clockwise until all dwarves are placed. Action types include:
   - Resource gathering (wood, stone, ore, food, grain, vegetables)
   - Building (fences, stables, rooms, tunnels, caverns)
   - Farming (sowing fields, breeding animals)
   - Family growth (adding new dwarves, requires a dwelling)
   - Expeditions (armed dwarves go on quests for varied rewards)
   - Furnishing (placing cave tiles with special abilities)
3. RETURN HOME - All dwarves return to the player's cave dwellings.
4. HARVEST (when triggered) - Not every round ends with a harvest. In
   rounds 1-4, only round 3 has a full harvest; round 4 requires paying
   1 food per dwarf instead. From round 5 onward, harvests occur by
   default but randomized harvest markers (placed face-down during setup
   on round spaces 6-12) can modify or skip them. When a harvest occurs,
   three sub-phases play out: (A) Field phase: remove one grain/vegetable
   from each sown field. (B) Feeding: pay food equal to 2 per adult dwarf,
   1 per child born this round. Shortfalls cost 3 negative VP per missing
   food. (C) Breeding: each pair of same-type farm animals produces one
   offspring (if housing exists).

### Key Design Patterns

SANDBOX OVER PRESSURE: Caverna's defining design choice relative to Agricola
is the deliberate reduction of punitive pressure. Agricola's negative scoring
for empty farm categories created anxiety; Caverna significantly softens this.
Caverna still penalizes players -2 points for each missing farm animal type
and -1 point for each unused home board space, but the penalties are fewer
in number and easier to avoid than Agricola's broader grid of negative
categories. The feeding requirement still exists but is far easier
to satisfy thanks to rubies (wild food), expeditions, and the sheer number of
food-generating options. This transforms the emotional texture from survival
to optimization. Rosenberg's insight was that the same core loop (place workers,
build farm, feed family) could serve a different player psychology by removing
the stick and enlarging the carrot. The design lesson: pressure and freedom
are dials, not binaries. Caverna proves you can preserve strategic depth
while dramatically reducing negative reinforcement.

TWIN SPATIAL PUZZLES: Each player board presents two distinct tile-placement
challenges. The forest half is cleared into meadows and fields, fenced into
pastures, and populated with animals. The cave half is mined into tunnels and
caverns, then furnished with special-ability tiles. These two grids share a
single board but operate under different placement rules: forest tiles are
about open space, fencing, and adjacency for animal management; cave tiles
are about tunnel connectivity and furnishing prerequisites. Skilled players
develop both halves in parallel, creating synergies between surface production
and subterranean bonuses. The twin-puzzle design doubles the spatial reasoning
without doubling the rules -- both halves use tile placement, but with
different topologies and rewards.

FURNISHING TILES AS OPEN TECH TREE: Caverna replaces Agricola's 300+ unique
cards with approximately 48 furnishing tiles available to all players equally.
Every tile is visible from the start, creating perfect information about
available upgrades. This is a fundamental design trade-off: Agricola's cards
created unique identities and high replayability through combinatorial variety,
but also created information asymmetry and occasional feel-bad moments when
opponents held stronger cards. Caverna's open furnishings let players plan
long-term strategies from turn one and eliminate the perceived unfairness of
card draws. The cost is reduced replayability and emergent surprise. Designers
should note: open tech trees favor strategic planning; hidden card pools favor
tactical adaptation. Neither is superior -- they serve different design goals.

EXPEDITION AS ALTERNATIVE ENGINE: Armed dwarves can undertake expeditions,
choosing rewards from a menu based on weapon strength (level 1-14). Higher
weapon levels unlock more powerful reward tiers: level 1 might yield a single
resource, while level 8 unlocks furnishing tiles, animals, or sowing actions.
This creates an entirely parallel economic pathway. A player who invests in
ore, weapon forging, and expeditions can bypass traditional farming almost
entirely, acquiring food, animals, and furnishings through adventuring rather
than agriculture. The expedition mechanic solves Agricola's strategic
convergence problem -- in Agricola, every player had to farm. In Caverna,
the adventure path creates genuine strategic diversity within the same game
framework.

ACCUMULATION SPACES: Many action spaces accumulate resources each round they
go unclaimed. A wood space that starts with 1 wood gains 1 more each round,
so by round 4 it offers 4 wood to whoever claims it. This creates natural
catch-up tension and opportunity-cost calculations. Taking a small pile early
is efficient but unexciting; waiting for accumulation is rewarding but risks
an opponent claiming it first. The accumulation mechanic also smooths player
count variance -- with fewer players, spaces accumulate faster, compensating
for fewer total worker placements. This is one of Rosenberg's signature design
tools, appearing across his entire worker-placement catalog, and it elegantly
self-balances the economy.

FAMILY GROWTH AS WORKER MULTIPLICATION: New dwarves require dwelling rooms
in the cave. Each dwelling room houses exactly two dwarves. Growing your
family is the game's primary engine accelerant -- more dwarves means more
actions per round, which compounds over the game's 12 rounds. But dwellings
consume cave space that could hold furnishing tiles, and new dwarves must be
fed. The tension between expanding your workforce and developing your
infrastructure is Caverna's central strategic dilemma. Early family growth
maximizes total actions but demands immediate food infrastructure; delayed
growth allows specialization but sacrifices tempo. The design pattern of
"workers as the engine" is common in the genre, but Caverna makes the
housing constraint unusually spatial -- you are literally building rooms
for your children.

PLAYER COUNT SCALING THROUGH ACTION SPACES: Caverna dynamically adjusts its
action space availability based on player count. At 2 players, fewer action
spaces are available; at 7 players, the full complement opens. This is not
simple dilution -- certain action spaces are specifically designed for higher
counts, maintaining competitive density regardless of group size. The game
also adjusts starting resources and available furnishings by count. Supporting
1-7 players is an extraordinary range for a game of this weight, and
Rosenberg achieves it through modular action-space design rather than rule
modifications. The principle: if your scaling mechanism is built into the
game's architecture (not patched on), it can support extreme player ranges
without feeling compromised at any count.

RUBY AS UNIVERSAL CURRENCY: Rubies function as Caverna's wildcard resource,
convertible to food, animals, building materials, field/tunnel/cavern tiles,
or spent to bypass the armed-dwarf play order (a powerful rule-breaker). They are scarce and primarily acquired
through cave development and certain expeditions. The design function of
rubies is to lubricate the economy -- they prevent players from being
completely locked out by resource scarcity or worker placement blocking.
A player with rubies always has options. This is an intentional pressure
valve, consistent with Caverna's philosophy of reducing frustration. The
design lesson: a universal wildcard resource, kept appropriately scarce,
can smooth out the harshest edges of a competitive system without trivializing
it.

### What Makes It #61

Caverna is Rosenberg's sandbox answer to his own masterwork. Where Agricola
is a survival game that punishes neglect, Caverna is an optimization game
that rewards ambition. The twin spatial puzzles of farm and cave, the open
furnishing tech tree, the expedition alternative to agriculture, and the
support for up to 7 players make it the most expansive worker-placement
game in the modern canon. Its design philosophy -- freedom over constraint,
abundance over scarcity -- creates a different emotional experience from its
predecessor without sacrificing mechanical depth. Caverna proves that a
designer can revisit their own system and find an entirely new design space
within it.
