## Design Notes

Designer: Corey Konieczka. Published by Fantasy Flight Games (2008).
Based on the Sci Fi Channel television series.

### Theme Integration

Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game is one of the most faithful television-to-
board-game adaptations ever produced. The game recreates the show's central
dramatic engine: a fleet of human survivors fleeing toward Earth while Cylon
infiltrators work to destroy them from within. Players take on the roles of
characters from the series --- William Adama, Laura Roslin, Kara "Starbuck" Thrace,
Gaius Baltar, and others --- each with abilities that mirror their television
counterparts. Starbuck is an expert pilot with reckless tendencies. Roslin wields
political influence through Quorum cards. Adama commands military authority as
Admiral. Baltar's ambiguous loyalty is mechanically encoded through special rules
that make him harder to identify as human or Cylon.

The game board depicts Galactica and Colonial One with their iconic locations ---
Command, the Brig, Sickbay, the Hangar Deck, the President's Office --- each
providing distinct actions that mirror their narrative function in the show. The four
resource dials (fuel, food, morale, population) create a persistent sense of scarcity
that captures the fleet's desperate situation. Civilian ships in the space areas carry
hidden population costs when destroyed, recreating the show's recurring agony of
losing irreplaceable lives. The Jump Preparation track builds tension toward each
FTL jump, the fleet's only means of progress toward Earth, while every turn spent
not jumping risks another Cylon attack that the dwindling resources cannot absorb.

The Sleeper Agent phase --- where additional Loyalty cards are dealt at the midpoint
--- directly translates the show's recurring revelation that trusted allies might be
Cylons. A player who was genuinely human for the first half of the game might
discover they are now a Cylon, creating the same identity crisis that drove the
show's most compelling storylines.

### Core Loop

Players take turns in clockwise order. Each turn consists of six steps performed
in sequence:

1. RECEIVE SKILLS --- Draw Skill Cards according to the character's skill set
   printed on their character sheet. Each character draws a specific number and type
   of cards (e.g., William Adama draws 3 Leadership and 2 Tactics). Multi-skill
   slots allow the player to choose between specified types.

2. MOVEMENT --- Optionally move the character token to a different location on
   Galactica or Colonial One. Moving between the two ships requires discarding
   one Skill Card. Characters piloting Vipers may move to adjacent space areas
   instead.

3. ACTION --- Perform one action from the following options:
   a) Activate the action listed on the character's current location.
   b) Play a Skill Card action from hand.
   c) Use a character ability listed on the character sheet.
   d) Activate a piloted Viper (move or attack a Cylon ship).
   e) Use a Title Card or Quorum Card action.
   f) Reveal a "You Are a Cylon" Loyalty Card (see Cylon rules).
   g) Do nothing.

4. CRISIS --- Draw the top card of the Crisis deck and resolve it. Crisis cards come
   in three types:
   a) Cylon Attack --- Place and activate Cylon ships according to the card's
      instructions. Raiders attack Vipers and civilian ships; Heavy Raiders
      advance on the Boarding Party track.
   b) Skill Check --- A challenge with a difficulty number and required skill types.
      Two cards from the Destiny deck are added facedown, then each player
      (starting left of the active player) contributes Skill Cards facedown. Cards
      are shuffled, revealed, and sorted: matching colors add their strength,
      non-matching colors subtract. If the total meets or exceeds the difficulty,
      the check passes; otherwise it fails with negative consequences.
   c) Event --- Follow the card's instructions, which may grant choices to the
      current player, President, or Admiral.

5. ACTIVATE CYLON SHIPS --- If Cylon ships are in play, they activate according to
   the icon on the drawn Crisis card (raiders attack, Heavy Raiders advance, or
   basestars fire).

6. PREPARE FOR JUMP --- If the Crisis card has a "prepare for jump" icon, advance
   the fleet marker on the Jump Preparation track. When it reaches Auto Jump,
   the fleet jumps: the Admiral draws two Destination cards, chooses one, and the
   fleet moves forward, spending fuel and potentially suffering other effects.

The game ends when the fleet has traveled at least eight distance units and
completes one final jump (humans win), or when any resource reaches zero at the
end of a turn, Galactica is destroyed (six damage tokens), or Centurions reach the
end of the Boarding Party track (Cylons win).

### Key Design Patterns

SKILL CHECK AS SOCIAL DEDUCTION ENGINE: The skill check is BSG's defining
mechanism and the traitor game genre's gold standard for hidden sabotage. When a
Crisis card calls for a skill check, all players contribute Skill Cards facedown to a
common pile. Two random cards from the Destiny deck are added, providing cover for
unexpected results. After shuffling, cards matching the check's required colors add
their strength while non-matching cards subtract. This structure creates the game's
central paranoia loop. When a check fails unexpectedly, players must determine
whether the negative cards came from the Destiny deck (random noise), a loyal
player who contributed the wrong color out of desperation, or a Cylon deliberately
sabotaging the effort. The facedown contribution and post-check shuffling ensure
that no individual's contribution can be definitively traced, maintaining suspicion
even when everyone claims to have helped. The Destiny deck is essential: by
injecting two random cards, it provides just enough plausible deniability that a
Cylon can sabotage a check and blame the randomness.

LOYALTY CARD DISTRIBUTION AS ESCALATING PARANOIA: The game distributes Loyalty
cards in two phases. At setup, each player receives one card from a deck containing
a calibrated ratio of "You Are a Cylon" and "You Are Not a Cylon" cards (e.g., one
Cylon card in five "Not a Cylon" for a three-player game). At the Sleeper Agent
phase (after four distance units are traveled), the remaining Loyalty cards are dealt.
This two-phase distribution creates a dramatic arc that mirrors the television show.
The first half of the game features at most one Cylon, making sabotage subtle and
suspicion low-grade. After the Sleeper Agent phase, a previously loyal player might
become a Cylon, shattering established trust relationships. The midgame
redistribution ensures that behavioral evidence from the first half becomes
unreliable, forcing constant reassessment.

RESOURCE DIALS AS SLOW-BURN DEFEAT: The four resource dials (fuel, food, morale,
population) are the primary Cylon victory mechanism. Resources are lost through
Crisis card effects, failed skill checks, destroyed civilian ships, and Galactica
damage. They are almost never replenished. This creates a relentless downward
pressure where even successful human play merely slows the decline. The Cylon
player's optimal strategy is often not dramatic sabotage but subtle, sustained
erosion --- contributing just enough to fail skill checks by small margins, choosing
the slightly worse option when making decisions as President or Admiral, or
encouraging risky jumps that cost extra fuel. The dials' visibility ensures all
players can see the fleet's slow deterioration, generating mounting anxiety that
mirrors the show's atmosphere of dwindling hope.

TITLE CARDS AS TRUST LEVERAGE: The President and Admiral titles grant powerful
abilities that are essential to human survival but devastating if held by a Cylon.
The Admiral chooses Destination cards during jumps, controls nuclear weapons, and
makes certain Crisis decisions. The President draws Quorum cards, influences
political crises, and accesses unique actions. If either title holder is a Cylon, they
can subtly steer decisions toward harmful outcomes while maintaining a facade of
cooperation. The game provides mechanisms to transfer titles --- the Administration
location allows nominating a new President through a skill check, while the
Admiral's Quarters allows accusing the Admiral --- creating a secondary political
game where players must decide whether to risk the disruption of a title challenge
based on incomplete evidence. The Brig location can imprison suspected Cylons,
severely limiting their actions, but imprisoning a loyal human wastes critical turns.

ASYMMETRIC CHARACTERS AS ROLE DIFFERENTIATION: Each character has a unique
skill set (determining which Skill Cards they draw), two positive abilities, and one
negative ability. Kara Thrace draws Tactics and Piloting but can take extra actions
at the cost of discards. Laura Roslin draws Politics and Leadership and can
manipulate the Destiny deck. The skill set distribution means certain characters are
naturally more effective at specific types of skill checks, creating organic role
specialization. A group without an Engineering-heavy character will struggle with
technical crises. These asymmetries also generate suspicion patterns: if the only
Piloting-skilled player is contributing poorly to Piloting checks, they become a prime
suspect --- unless they are genuinely unlucky with draws.

CYLON REVEAL AS DRAMATIC PIVOT: A player who discovers they are a Cylon (or
who has been playing as a hidden Cylon) may reveal at any time as their action.
Upon revealing, they discard down to three Skill Cards, lose any titles, move to the
Resurrection Ship (a Cylon-only location), and receive a Super Crisis card. From
this point, they play a fundamentally different game: drawing only two cards per
turn, moving between Cylon locations, and contributing a single card to skill checks.
The reveal is a one-way door with massive narrative and mechanical consequences.
Early reveals sacrifice subtlety for direct Cylon action. Late reveals maintain
maximum sabotage time but risk discovery and imprisonment. The timing of a Cylon
reveal is frequently the game's most memorable moment, particularly when it
involves surrendering a title that was being used to subtly undermine the fleet.

JUMP PREPARATION AS PACING MECHANISM: The Jump Preparation track is the game's
clock. Crisis cards with the "prepare for jump" icon advance the fleet marker one
space toward Auto Jump. Players can also force early jumps using the FTL Control
location, but premature jumps risk population loss. Each jump resets the board ---
all ships are removed, the track resets --- creating a cyclical rhythm of building
crisis, desperate defense, and release through escape. The Admiral's choice of
Destination card determines how much distance is gained and at what resource cost,
making each jump a high-stakes decision point. The track ensures the game has
forward momentum even when players are locked in political arguments about
who is a Cylon.

LOCATION ACTIONS AS SPATIAL DILEMMA: Characters must physically move to
locations to use their actions, and moving between Galactica and Colonial One
costs a Skill Card discard. This spatial constraint forces players to commit to
strategies for multiple turns --- a character who moves to Colonial One for political
actions cannot quickly return to pilot a Viper during a Cylon attack. The two Hazard
locations (Sickbay and Brig) impose ongoing penalties on characters sent there,
creating punishment spaces that serve both gameplay and thematic functions. The
geographic separation between political action (Colonial One) and military action
(Galactica) mirrors the show's recurring tension between civilian and military
authority.

### What Makes It #123

Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game remains the benchmark for the hidden traitor
genre because every mechanism serves the paranoia engine. The skill check
system --- with its facedown contributions, Destiny deck noise, and post-shuffle
anonymity --- creates a forensic puzzle that players argue about for hours after the
game ends. The two-phase Loyalty card distribution generates a dramatic arc from
cautious cooperation to shattered trust. The resource dials provide a slow-burn
defeat mechanism that makes subtle sabotage more effective than dramatic betrayal.
And the title system means that the most powerful positions in the game are also the
most dangerous if compromised. Konieczka's achievement was recognizing that the
Battlestar Galactica television series was fundamentally about trust under pressure,
and building every mechanism around generating, testing, and destroying that trust.
The result is a game where the table talk --- the accusations, the defenses, the
desperate pleas for cooperation --- is not incidental to the experience; it is the
experience.
