### Theme Integration

Patchwork presents two quilters competing to assemble the most aesthetic and
economically efficient patchwork quilt. Players draft polyomino-shaped fabric
patches from a shared circular market and fit them onto a personal 9x9 grid
board. The quilting theme is not arbitrary window dressing — it provides the
logical framework for the game's spatial puzzle. Real quilters select fabric
pieces from available scraps, paying in both material (buttons, the game's
currency) and time (the effort of sewing), and the satisfaction of the craft
comes from fitting irregular shapes into a coherent whole. Rosenberg
translated this process into a game where every patch has a button cost, a
time cost, and a unique shape that must be rotated and placed onto the grid.
The theme gives new players an immediate intuitive understanding of what
they are doing, even before the rules are fully absorbed.

Buttons serve a dual role that mirrors their real-world function in quilting.
In the game, buttons are both currency (spent to purchase patches) and victory
points (counted at game end). Patches with button icons printed on them
generate income each time a player passes an income marker on the time track.
This creates a thematic resonance: the more decorative patches you
incorporate into your quilt, the more valuable the finished product becomes.
The empty spaces on your quilt board — uncovered squares — each cost two
buttons at game end, representing the waste and incompleteness of unfinished
work. The entire economy is expressed through a single resource, and the
theme makes both the earning and the penalty feel logical rather than
arbitrary.

The time track is the game's most thematically grounded mechanism. Instead
of alternating turns, the player who is further behind on the time track
always takes the next action. This models the quilting reality that larger,
more complex patches take longer to sew. A player who purchases a large,
expensive patch may advance far along the time track, giving their opponent
several consecutive turns to collect smaller patches. The time track makes
the quilting metaphor structural: every patch purchase is a time investment,
and the game's rhythm emerges from the interplay between ambition and
efficiency.

### Core Loop

The game is played on a central time track (a linear path of spaces) with a
shared circular market of patches arranged around a central pawn. Each player
has a personal 9x9 grid board and a supply of buttons.

**On Your Turn (the player further behind on the time track always acts):**

1. CHOOSE ONE OF TWO ACTIONS:
   a) ADVANCE AND COLLECT — Move your time marker forward on the track to
      the space directly in front of your opponent's marker. Collect one
      button per space moved. This is the fallback action when no affordable
      or desirable patch is available.
   b) PURCHASE A PATCH — Choose one of the three patches immediately ahead
      of the neutral pawn in the circular market. Pay its button cost. Advance
      your time marker by its time cost. Place the patch on your quilt board
      (may rotate and flip). Move the neutral pawn to the position the
      purchased patch occupied.

2. INCOME TRIGGERS — When your time marker passes or lands on a button icon
   on the time track, collect income: one button per button icon printed on
   patches already placed on your quilt board.

3. SINGLE-SQUARE PATCHES — When your time marker passes or lands on a
   leather patch icon on the time track, immediately take a 1x1 patch tile
   and place it anywhere on your quilt board. These are first-come,
   first-served.

4. BONUS TILE — The first player to completely fill a 7x7 area on their
   quilt board claims the special bonus tile worth 7 points.

**End Game**: The game ends when both players reach the end of the time track.
Final scoring: count remaining buttons, subtract 2 points per uncovered
square on the quilt board, add 7 points if you claimed the bonus tile.
Highest score wins.

### Key Design Patterns

TIME TRACK AS TURN ORDER: The time track is Patchwork's defining mechanism
and one of the most elegant turn-order innovations in modern design. Instead
of alternating turns, the player who is further behind always goes next. If
you purchase a patch with a high time cost, you advance far on the track,
and your opponent may take two, three, or even four consecutive turns before
you act again. This replaces the traditional notion of "fairness through
alternation" with fairness through resource balancing — you pay for powerful
actions by ceding tempo. The mechanism makes every purchase a dual
calculation: what is the patch worth spatially and economically, and how
many turns am I giving up to get it? Games that adopted this mechanism
(Tokaido, Glen More, Thebes) inherited Patchwork's fundamental insight that
time itself can be a spendable resource.

CIRCULAR MARKET WITH LIMITED VISIBILITY: The patches are arranged in a circle
around a neutral pawn, and you can only purchase one of the three patches
immediately in front of the pawn. After a purchase, the pawn moves to that
position, changing which three patches are available next. This creates a
sequential visibility window that prevents perfect optimization. You can see
the entire market, so you can plan ahead, but your opponent's purchases
shift the pawn and change what becomes available to you. The circular
structure also means patches cycle — a patch you skip now will eventually
come around again, but the timing is unpredictable. This mechanism generates
strategic depth from minimal components: no shuffling, no randomness after
setup, just a sliding window of constrained choice.

POLYOMINO SPATIAL PUZZLE: Each patch has a unique shape — Tetris-like
polyominoes of varying sizes and configurations. Players must physically fit
these shapes onto their 9x9 grid, rotating and flipping them to minimize
gaps. The spatial puzzle is the game's primary skill expression. No amount
of economic optimization compensates for poor spatial planning, because
every uncovered square costs 2 buttons at game end. A full 9x9 grid has
81 squares; even five uncovered squares is a 10-point penalty that can swing
the game. The polyomino mechanism creates a tension between economic value
(patches with high button income) and spatial value (patches that fill gaps
efficiently). The best players evaluate both dimensions simultaneously.

DUAL-PURPOSE CURRENCY: Buttons are both the currency for purchasing patches
and the victory points counted at game end. This dual purpose creates a
spending paradox: every button you spend on a patch is a victory point you
no longer have, but the patches you buy generate future income and fill
scoring-relevant grid space. The optimal strategy is not to hoard buttons
or to spend them all, but to invest early in income-generating patches
(which pay back their cost over time) and then accumulate buttons in the
late game when fewer purchases remain. Rosenberg collapses what could be
two separate resource systems into one, and the dual purpose makes every
transaction legible — you always know exactly what you are trading and
what it costs.

INCOME TIMING AS INVESTMENT CURVE: The time track has a fixed number of
income trigger points (button icons) spaced along its length. When you pass
one, you collect buttons equal to the button icons on your placed patches.
Early-game patches with button icons are investments: they generate income
at every subsequent trigger. Late-game patches with button icons may only
trigger once or not at all. This creates a natural investment curve — income
patches are most valuable early, spatial patches become more valuable late.
Players must read the time track to understand how many income triggers
remain and adjust their purchasing strategy accordingly.

MINIMALIST INFORMATION DESIGN: Patchwork achieves remarkable depth with
almost no hidden information and no randomness after initial setup. Both
players can see the entire circular market, the time track, each other's
quilt boards, and each other's button supply. Every decision is fully
informed. The only uncertainty is your opponent's intentions — which
patches they want and when they will choose to advance instead of purchase.
This transparency makes Patchwork a pure strategy game dressed in
accessible clothing. It also makes the game deeply respectful of the
players' time: there is nothing to memorize, nothing to track privately,
and nothing to calculate beyond what is visible on the table.

THE 7x7 BONUS AS RACING INCENTIVE: The special bonus tile, awarded to the
first player who completely fills a 7x7 area on their board, is worth 7
points. In a game where final scores often range from 10 to 40 points, 7
points is enormous. The bonus creates a secondary objective that may
conflict with optimal spatial planning — filling a 7x7 area quickly may
require accepting suboptimal patches or leaving other areas of the board
unfilled. It also creates direct competition in a game that is otherwise
parallel: both players are building separate quilts, but the 7x7 race
forces them to monitor each other's boards and potentially accelerate their
purchases to claim the bonus first.

### What Makes It #146

Patchwork is the most successful dedicated two-player game in modern board
gaming, and its design explains why. Rosenberg compressed the worker
placement and resource management concepts from his heavier designs
(Agricola, A Feast for Odin) into a 15-30 minute experience that loses
none of the strategic density. The time track mechanism eliminates the
artificial symmetry of alternating turns and replaces it with organic tempo
management. The polyomino puzzle provides visual and tactile satisfaction
that transcends language barriers. The button economy is so clean that the
entire game can be taught in three minutes. At 1.60 weight, Patchwork
occupies a unique position: it is light enough to play casually but deep
enough that expert players consistently outperform beginners, a balance
that very few designs achieve. It is the definitive proof that a great
game needs only one innovative mechanism executed with precision.
