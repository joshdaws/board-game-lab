### Theme Integration

Rising Sun transplants feudal Japanese mythology into a grand strategic
contest where gods, monsters, and clan honor shape the fate of the
islands. The game's mythological framework is not decorative — it is
the mechanical backbone. Each player controls a clan with a unique
supernatural patron and ability set, drawn from Japanese folklore:
the Koi clan channels transformation and adaptability, Bonsai embodies
efficiency and minimalism, Lotus wields political manipulation, Dragonfly
commands speed and mobility, and Turtle relies on defensive resilience.
The clan abilities are not arbitrary bonuses; they are mechanical
translations of the mythological qualities each symbol represents.
A turtle's shell becomes a defensive combat bonus. A dragonfly's speed
becomes enhanced movement range. The thematic mapping gives each clan
an intuitive identity that new players can grasp before understanding
the mechanical implications.

The seasonal structure reinforces the mythological framing. The game
proceeds through Spring, Summer, and Autumn — each season escalating
in intensity as more powerful Kami (gods) become available, larger
monsters can be recruited, and the political landscape becomes more
volatile. Winter never arrives in the game; victory is determined at
autumn's end, before the cold sets in. This seasonal arc creates a
natural dramatic structure: Spring establishes alliances and territory,
Summer tests those alliances through escalating conflict, and Autumn
forces final decisive battles for dominance. The absence of Winter
implies that the winning clan has secured enough power to weather
whatever comes next — victory is not about surviving the storm but
about making the storm unnecessary.

The monster recruitment system deepens the mythological integration.
Each season reveals new Shinto monsters — Oni, Komainu, Jorogumo,
and others — that can be recruited to your cause. Monsters provide
powerful combat abilities and strategic options, but they also carry
thematic weight: summoning supernatural allies represents a clan's
spiritual authority and willingness to traffic with dangerous forces.
The most powerful monsters demand the most strategic commitment to
acquire, mirroring folklore traditions where greater supernatural
aid comes with greater cost.

### Core Loop

The game spans three seasons (Spring, Summer, Autumn), each following
the same structural arc: a political mandate phase, followed by war.

**PHASE 1 — TEA CEREMONY (Alliance Formation)**

At the start of each season, players negotiate and form alliances. An
alliance is a mutual agreement between exactly two players that provides
shared benefits throughout the season. Allied players gain bonuses when
either partner selects certain political mandates. Alliances are binding
for the season but dissolve at its end — and critically, allied players
still compete for territory during the war phase. Alliance negotiation is
open, unrestricted, and may include promises about future actions (which
are not mechanically enforced).

1. Players discuss and negotiate openly.
2. Each player simultaneously indicates their preferred alliance partner.
3. Mutual selections form alliances; unmatched selections result in no
   alliance for that player.

**PHASE 2 — POLITICAL MANDATES**

Each season has a deck of political mandate cards. A number of mandates
equal to the player count plus two are drawn and placed in a queue. The
current political leader (starting with the player who has the most
honor) selects one mandate from the available options, executing it
immediately. All players benefit from the mandate, but the selecting
player and their ally receive enhanced benefits.

Mandate types include:

1. RECRUIT — Place figures (Shinto warriors, Daimyo, monsters) from your
   reserve onto provinces you control. Your ally also recruits.
2. MARSHAL — Move figures between adjacent provinces. Your ally also
   marshals.
3. TRAIN — Acquire season cards (powerful one-time or ongoing abilities)
   from the display. Your ally also trains.
4. HARVEST — Gain coins and victory points based on the provinces you
   occupy. Your ally also harvests.
5. BETRAY — Execute an aggressive action against any player, including
   your ally. Your ally does NOT benefit from Betray — this mandate tests
   the limits of trust.

After resolving a mandate, the next player in honor order selects the
next mandate, continuing until all mandates for the season are resolved.

**PHASE 3 — WAR**

After all mandates are resolved, war erupts across all contested
provinces (provinces containing figures from multiple clans). Wars are
resolved province by province in a fixed geographical order.

For each contested province:

1. All involved players simultaneously and secretly allocate coins to
   four war advantages using a bidding screen:
   - SEPPUKU — Your figures die honorably; you gain honor and VP for
     each lost figure.
   - TAKE HOSTAGE — Capture enemy figures for VP and return them to
     the owner's reserve.
   - HIRE RONIN — Add temporary mercenary strength to your force.
   - IMPERIAL POETS — Gain VP regardless of battle outcome.
2. Reveal bids simultaneously.
3. Resolve each advantage in order — highest bidder in each category
   wins that advantage. Ties broken by honor.
4. After all advantages resolve, the player with the most total force
   (figures plus Ronin) remaining in the province wins, placing a
   control token.

**SEASON END**

Score province control, resolve end-of-season effects, discard seasonal
elements, and advance to the next season. After Autumn's war phase,
conduct final scoring with set collection bonuses for province control
across different regions, monster collection, and honor track position.

### Key Design Patterns

ALLIANCE AS STRUCTURED BETRAYAL: The alliance system's genius lies in
its temporal boundaries and competitive overlay. Alliances last exactly
one season, dissolve automatically, and — crucially — do not prevent
allies from fighting each other during the war phase. This structure
creates a paradox: your ally is your greatest asset during the mandate
phase (doubled benefits) and your greatest threat during war (they know
your positions and capabilities). The Betray mandate crystallizes this
tension into a single action — you can betray your ally mid-season for
tactical advantage, but doing so destroys trust for future alliance
negotiations. The system generates narratives of cooperation and
betrayal not through random events but through the mechanical incentives
of temporary mutual benefit followed by inevitable competition.

SEALED-BID COMBAT AS PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE: Rising Sun's war phase
replaces dice rolling with simultaneous sealed bidding across four
war advantages. This transforms combat from a probability exercise
into a psychological reading of opponents. You are not asking "will
I roll well?" but "what does my opponent value?" A player who commits
all coins to Seppuku accepts defeat but converts it into honor and VP
— effectively winning by losing. A player who bids heavily on Ronin
seeks pure military dominance. The four-category bid structure means
every battle contains multiple sub-contests, and a player can lose
the battle but win enough advantages to come out ahead in points.
Deterministic combat through hidden allocation makes every war feel
like a negotiation rather than a dice roll.

HONOR AS TIEBREAKER CURRENCY: The honor track determines turn order,
alliance initiative, and — most critically — breaks all ties. In a
game where sealed bids frequently produce identical amounts, honor is
not a secondary resource but a decisive one. Gaining honor through
Seppuku or certain mandates is an investment in future tiebreaking
power. Losing honor through betrayal or certain aggressive actions
is a tangible strategic cost. The honor track creates a metagame
where reputation has mechanical consequences: the most honorable
player wins every tied bid, making them a more dangerous opponent
in war even with fewer coins.

THE BETRAY MANDATE AS TRUST TEST: Among the five mandate types, Betray
is unique — it is the only mandate where your ally does not receive a
bonus. Selecting Betray while allied sends an unambiguous signal: you
are willing to exploit the alliance's proximity for unilateral gain.
The design choice to include an explicit betrayal mechanism within the
alliance framework forces players to constantly evaluate whether their
partner will stay loyal or defect. The Betray mandate is Rising Sun's
contribution to the trust literature in game design — it proves that
structured betrayal creates more interesting social dynamics than either
permanent alliances or unrestricted hostility.

SEPPUKU AS STRATEGIC SACRIFICE: The Seppuku war advantage converts
military defeat into honor and victory points. This inverts the
typical wargame logic where losing figures is purely negative. A player
can deliberately position figures in a province they expect to lose,
bid heavily on Seppuku, and convert those figures into points that
exceed what winning the province would have yielded. The mechanic
rewards strategic sacrifice and punishes opponents who assume that
military superiority is always advantageous — killing an enemy's
figures might be exactly what they want. Seppuku demonstrates how a
single scoring mechanism can invert an entire game's strategic calculus.

SEASONAL ESCALATION THROUGH CARD POWER: Each season introduces
progressively more powerful season cards (abilities, monsters, and
bonuses). Spring cards offer modest advantages; Autumn cards can
reshape the game. This escalation ensures that early-game decisions
establish positioning while late-game decisions determine outcomes.
The escalation also creates a natural tension between investing in
cards early (when they are weaker but provide more rounds of value)
versus waiting for powerful Autumn cards (which have less time to
generate returns but offer stronger individual effects).

MANDATE SELECTION AS SHARED ACTION: The political mandate system creates
a paradox of control. The player who selects a mandate gets an enhanced
version, and their ally benefits equally — but all other players also
execute the mandate at reduced power. You cannot take an action without
giving something to everyone else. This shared-benefit structure means
that mandate selection is partly about which action helps you most and
partly about which action helps your opponents least. The design
prevents any player from accumulating power in isolation and ensures
that every round involves collective advancement, with differential
rather than absolute gains determining the outcome.

### What Makes It #153

Rising Sun succeeds by replacing the randomness of miniatures combat
with the psychology of hidden allocation, transforming a genre defined
by dice into one defined by reading opponents. The alliance system
creates some of the most memorable social moments in modern gaming —
the season where your trusted ally bids against you in every province,
the Seppuku gambit that converts a massacre into a point windfall, the
Betray mandate that reshuffles the political landscape mid-season. Eric
Lang's design proves that area control games need not depend on
probabilistic combat to generate tension; sealed bids and structured
social contracts create deeper, more personal conflict than any dice
could. The game's mythological framing elevates what could be a dry
strategic exercise into an epic narrative of honor, ambition, and
betrayal played out across the islands of a supernatural Japan.
