### Theme Integration

Dominion: Intrigue shifts the original Dominion's pastoral kingdom-building toward
the murkier world of court politics, espionage, and manipulation. Where the base
game's cards depicted straightforward economic activities --- markets, workshops,
mines --- Intrigue populates its supply piles with cards named Swindler, Torturer,
Saboteur, Conspirator, and Minion. The medieval setting is the same, but the tone
is darker and more interpersonal. You are no longer simply building an efficient
economic engine; you are navigating a court where every action might undermine a
rival's position. The thematic shift is not cosmetic --- it signals a genuine
mechanical evolution toward greater player interaction and more disruptive card
effects that force opponents to react rather than simply optimize in parallel.

The introduction of multi-choice action cards --- cards that present two or more
effects and require the player to choose one --- maps naturally to the theme of
political maneuvering. A courtier might choose between bribery and intimidation;
a noble might choose between influence and direct action. The mechanical
expression of choice is the thematic expression of political flexibility. Victory
cards with abilities (such as the Nobles card, which can serve as either +3 Cards
or +2 Actions in addition to its 2 VP value) model the dual nature of political
power: it is both an end in itself and a means to further action. These hybrid
cards blur the boundary between the engine you build and the victory points you
accumulate, creating a design space where scoring is not purely dead weight in
your deck.

The expansion's suitability for combination with the base game --- enabling 5-6
player sessions --- reflects the thematic expansion of a kingdom's political
landscape. More players mean more competing factions, more contested supply piles,
and more unpredictable card interactions, amplifying the intrigue that gives the
set its name.

### Core Loop

Dominion: Intrigue uses the same fundamental deckbuilding loop as the base game,
with the supply configured from its own set of 25 Kingdom cards:

1. ACTION PHASE --- Play action cards from your hand one at a time. Each action
   card provides some combination of additional actions, additional buys, additional
   cards drawn, coins, or special effects. Multi-choice cards (new to Intrigue)
   require the player to select one effect from two or more options before resolving.
   Attack cards (more prevalent than in the base game) force opponents to discard,
   trash cards, replace cards, or suffer other penalties. Reaction cards may be
   revealed from hand to counter attacks.

2. BUY PHASE --- Spend coins generated by Treasure cards and action effects to
   purchase cards from the supply. Each bought card goes to your discard pile.
   The supply includes Treasure cards, Victory cards (including hybrid Victory-
   Action cards unique to Intrigue), action cards, and Curse cards. Players may
   make multiple purchases if they have gained additional buys from action cards.

3. CLEANUP PHASE --- Discard all played cards and remaining hand cards. Draw five
   new cards from your deck. If the deck is empty, shuffle the discard pile to
   form a new deck.

4. The game ends when the Province pile is empty or any three supply piles are
   exhausted. The player with the most victory points in their deck wins.

The supply is configured before each game by selecting 10 of the 25 available
Kingdom cards, ensuring that no two games present the same strategic landscape.
Intrigue's Kingdom cards can be mixed with those from any other Dominion set.

### Key Design Patterns

MULTI-CHOICE CARDS AS TACTICAL FLEXIBILITY: Intrigue's signature innovation is
the multi-choice action card --- cards that present the player with two or more
mutually exclusive effects. The Steward offers "+2 Cards," "Trash 2 cards from
hand," or "+2 Coins." The Nobles card functions as either "+3 Cards" or "+2
Actions." This design pattern transforms card evaluation from a static assessment
(this card does X) into a contextual one (this card does X or Y depending on my
game state). Multi-choice cards increase the skill ceiling of deckbuilding because
the optimal choice varies based on hand composition, deck cycle timing, and
opponent board state. A Steward that draws cards early in the game becomes a
trasher mid-game and a money source late. The same card serves three strategic
functions across the arc of a single session.

HYBRID VICTORY-ACTION CARDS: In base Dominion, Victory cards are pure dead weight
in your deck until final scoring --- they clog your hand without contributing to
your engine. Intrigue introduces Victory cards that also function as action cards,
fundamentally altering the deckbuilding calculus. Nobles (2 VP, plus an action
effect) means that acquiring victory points does not necessarily degrade your
engine's efficiency. This design pattern addresses a core tension in deckbuilding
games: the conflict between building an engine and acquiring victory points. By
making some victory points engine-compatible, Intrigue opens strategic paths
where early green card acquisition is viable rather than purely suicidal. The
hybrid design also creates interesting trashing decisions --- do you trash a
card that has both engine and scoring value?

ELEVATED ATTACK DENSITY: Intrigue increases the proportion of attack cards in
the supply compared to the base game. Cards like Torturer (forcing opponents to
either discard two cards or gain a Curse), Swindler (trashing the top card of
an opponent's deck and replacing it with a card of equal cost that you choose),
and Saboteur (trashing an opponent's high-cost card) create significantly more
disruption. The elevated attack density shifts the strategic landscape from
parallel optimization toward interactive disruption, where reading opponents'
deck compositions and timing attacks for maximum impact become core skills. This
density also elevates the value of Reaction cards and defensive strategies,
creating a metagame around anticipating and countering aggression.

VARIABLE SETUP AS REPLAYABILITY ENGINE: The 25 Kingdom cards in Intrigue,
combined with the 10-card supply selection rule, produce over 3 million possible
supply configurations from Intrigue alone. When combined with cards from the base
game or other expansions, the combinatorial space becomes effectively infinite.
This variable setup pattern is the foundation of Dominion's longevity as a design.
Each configuration creates a different strategic puzzle: some supplies favor
aggressive strategies (heavy attack cards), others reward engine-building (strong
draw and action chains), and others create unusual combo opportunities. The
variable setup transforms Dominion from a single game into a game system.

DELAYED PURCHASE AND DECK CYCLING: The deckbuilding mechanic itself embodies the
Delayed Purchase pattern. Cards bought this turn enter the discard pile, not the
hand, and become available only after the deck is reshuffled. This delay creates
a planning horizon unique to deckbuilding games: every purchase is an investment
in future turns, and the timing of that payoff depends on deck size and cycle
speed. Intrigue's trashing cards (like Steward and Trading Post) interact with
this pattern by shrinking deck size, accelerating cycle speed, and bringing
newly purchased cards into hand sooner. The interplay between acquisition timing,
deck thinning, and cycle management is the mathematical backbone of competitive
Dominion play.

INTERACTION THROUGH CARD MANIPULATION: Beyond direct attacks, Intrigue introduces
cards that manipulate the supply and opponents' decks in subtler ways. Masquerade
passes cards between players; Swindler replaces opponents' cards with your choice
of alternatives. These effects create interaction that is not purely destructive
but strategically disruptive --- you can degrade an opponent's deck composition
without simply removing cards. This pattern extends the design space of player
interaction beyond the binary of "help yourself" or "hurt opponents" into a
richer territory of manipulation and redirection.

### What Makes It #131

Dominion: Intrigue earns its place by proving that the deckbuilding framework
could support meaningfully different strategic experiences within the same rule
system. The base game demonstrated that deckbuilding worked; Intrigue demonstrated
that it could evolve. Multi-choice cards, hybrid victory cards, and elevated
attack density collectively shift the game from an optimization puzzle toward a
more interactive, more tactically demanding experience without adding mechanical
complexity. The weight increase from base Dominion is negligible, but the
decision density per card play increases substantially. Intrigue remains the most
recommended entry point for players who want Dominion with teeth --- the political
theme is not just flavor, it is a design philosophy that values disruption,
adaptation, and reading opponents as much as engine efficiency.
