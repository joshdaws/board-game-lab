## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

The Spice must flow — and it does, mechanically. Dune: Imperium puts players
as Leaders of Great Houses vying for control of Arrakis and influence across
the Imperium. The deck-building represents your political network: starting
cards are generic agents and daggers, but acquired cards represent alliances
with Fremen warriors, Bene Gesserit manipulators, Spacing Guild navigators,
and Imperial power brokers. Worker placement represents deploying agents to
key locations — the spice fields, political councils, military outposts. The
four Influence tracks (Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, Fremen) map
directly to the novel's power factions, and gaining enough influence with any
faction earns their Alliance token. Combat on Arrakis isn't abstracted — you
commit troops to the Conflict area and fight for rewards drawn from an
escalating Conflict deck (Tier I → II → III) that mirrors the novel's rising
stakes. Even spice accumulation works thematically: desert board spaces
generate Maker icons, and spice piles up on them between rounds until someone
harvests it — sandworms make the spice, and you time your harvest.

### Core Loop

Fixed 10-round game. Each round has 5 phases:

1. ROUND START - Reveal a new Conflict card (determines combat stakes this
   round). Conflict deck escalates: Tier I in early rounds, Tier II mid-game,
   Tier III late-game.
2. PLAYER TURNS - Players alternate taking one turn each. Two turn types:
   a) AGENT TURN - Play a card from hand, send an Agent to a matching board
      space (card must have the right icon), gain that space's reward. Card
      goes face-up in your play area.
   b) REVEAL TURN - When out of Agents (or choosing to stop), reveal remaining
      hand. Gain Persuasion (sum of card values) to buy new cards from the
      Imperium Row. Gain sword icons for Combat strength. Once revealed, you
      take no more turns this round.
3. COMBAT - All players with troops in the Conflict area resolve combat.
   Strength = troops (2 each) + swords from revealed cards (1 each) + Intrigue
   combat cards. Winner gets top Conflict reward; others get consolation prizes
   in strength order. Ties broken by first-to-deploy.
4. MAKERS - Add spice to each unoccupied desert board space with a Maker icon.
   Spice accumulates round over round until someone claims it.
5. RECALL - Return all Agents to supply. Clean up for next round.

Win condition: First to 10 VP (or most VP when Conflict deck empties, typically
round 10). VP from Conflict victories, faction Alliances, controlling key
board spaces, and Endgame Intrigue cards.

### Key Design Patterns

DECK-BUILDING MEETS WORKER PLACEMENT: The central innovation. Your hand of
cards doesn't just give you resources — it determines WHERE you can place
workers. Each card has Agent icons (arrows in colored boxes) that gate which
board spaces you can access. A card with a Fremen icon lets you send an Agent
to Fremen-affiliated spaces. A card with a Spacing Guild icon opens Guild
spaces. Your starting deck has generic icons that access basic spaces, but
acquired cards open up powerful faction-specific locations. This means
deck-building isn't just about acquiring good cards — it's about acquiring
ACCESS. The two systems feed each other: worker placement rewards help you
deck-build, and deck composition determines your placement options.

AGENT TURN VS REVEAL TURN SPLIT: Each round, you alternate between Agent turns
(playing one card, placing one worker) and eventually a Reveal turn (showing
your remaining hand for Persuasion and Combat). The tension: every card played
as an Agent is a card NOT contributing Persuasion or swords during Reveal.
Strong Agent plays cost you buying power and combat strength. You decide each
turn — play another Agent for board-space rewards, or Reveal early to maximize
Persuasion for deck-building and swords for Combat? Two Agents means two cards
played and fewer revealed. This split creates a natural pacing decision every
single turn.

CARD ANATOMY (DUAL-FUNCTION): Every card has two functional zones. The Agent
box (left side) shows the icons that gate board space access AND any bonus
effect when played as an Agent. The Reveal box (bottom) shows Persuasion value
and sword icons gained when the card is revealed instead. Some cards are strong
Agent plays (great icon access, powerful Agent effects) but weak on Reveal
(low Persuasion). Others are weak to play as Agents but provide massive
Persuasion or swords on Reveal. This dual structure means every card in your
deck serves two potential purposes, and the right choice depends on the
round's tactical situation.

CONFLICT DECK ESCALATION: The Conflict deck is divided into three tiers. Tier I
rewards (early game) are modest — 1 VP, some resources, maybe a troop. Tier II
(mid-game) escalates — 2 VP, faction Influence, powerful effects. Tier III
(late game) is where the game swings — 3 VP, multiple Influence, game-changing
rewards. This built-in escalation means early combat matters less (you're
building your engine) and late combat matters enormously (you're fighting for
the win). The structure creates a natural narrative arc without any scenario
scripting — stakes rise automatically.

FOUR-FACTION INFLUENCE SYSTEM: Four Influence tracks (Emperor, Spacing Guild,
Bene Gesserit, Fremen) each run 0-6. Board spaces and card effects push you
up these tracks. At specific thresholds you gain bonuses (resources, troops,
cards). Reach the top and claim that faction's Alliance token — worth 1 VP
and a powerful ongoing ability. But Alliances are precarious: if another player
reaches the same level, they STEAL your Alliance token. This creates a race
on each track and a defensive concern — do you diversify across factions or
commit to one and defend your lead? The four tracks give the game enormous
strategic variety: Fremen-heavy, Guild-focused, Emperor-aligned, and Bene
Gesserit manipulation are all viable paths.

INTRIGUE CARDS AS HIDDEN INFORMATION: Intrigue cards are gained from specific
board spaces and card effects, held secretly in hand (separate from your deck).
Three types: Plot (play anytime for resources/effects), Combat (play during
Combat for strength and bonuses), Endgame (score VP at game end if conditions
met). Intrigue cards inject hidden information into an otherwise open-state
game. You can see opponents' troops and board positions, but you can't see
their Intrigue cards. A player with 3 Combat Intrigue cards looks weak at 2
troops but could surge to massive strength. This uncertainty prevents
deterministic combat calculation and keeps every conflict tense.

MAKER SPICE ACCUMULATION: Desert board spaces (The Great Flat, Hagga Basin,
Imperial Basin) have Maker icons. During the Makers phase, each UNOCCUPIED
desert space with a Maker icon gains 1 spice from the bank. Spice accumulates
across rounds — if nobody visits The Great Flat for 3 rounds, it has 3 bonus
spice waiting. This creates a natural tension: early desert visits yield less
spice, but waiting means someone else grabs the jackpot. The mechanic rewards
timing and punishes predictability. It also simulates the sandworm-spice cycle
from the novel — spice builds up in the deep desert until someone risks the
harvest.

CONTROL BONUSES: Three board spaces (Arrakeen, Carthag, Imperial Basin) have
Control bonuses printed on the board. During Combat, whoever has troops in the
Conflict AND controls the most of these spaces gets an edge — extra card draws,
extra Persuasion, extra VP. Control is determined by having a garrison (flag
token) on the space, earned by sending an Agent there. Control creates
positional strategy beyond pure Combat strength — you can win fights by
controlling territory, not just deploying more troops.

THE PERSUASION ECONOMY: Persuasion is Dune Imperium's purchasing currency,
generated during the Reveal turn from your revealed cards. It buys cards from
the Imperium Row (5 face-up cards from the Imperium Deck, refreshing as
purchased) or the always-available Reserve cards (Arrakis Liaison and The
Spice Must Flow). The Imperium Row creates a shared market — everyone sees
what's available, and timing your Reveal turn to buy key cards before opponents
is critical. The Spice Must Flow (costs 9 Persuasion) is the endgame finisher:
it provides a VP when acquired and can be trashed for another VP.

LEADER ASYMMETRY: Eight Leaders (two from each Great House — Atreides,
Harkonnen, Richese, Ecaz in the base game) provide starting asymmetry. Each
Leader has a unique signet ring ability (usable once per round when sending an
Agent) that bends the rules in a specific direction. Leaders don't radically
transform the game but give each player a slight edge toward a particular
strategy, encouraging different approaches from turn one.

HOUSE HAGAL (SOLO/2-PLAYER): For solo and 2-player games, House Hagal provides
automated opponents via a simple card-flip system. A Hagal deck determines
where rival Agents go — flip a card, place a rival Agent on the indicated
space (blocking it from you). Rivals accumulate troops and fight in Combat
using a separate strength card. This fills the board without requiring a human
to manage multiple factions, preserving the worker-blocking tension that makes
the game tick at higher player counts.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1-4 players: Board spaces scale — some spaces have 2 Agent slots (one
  labeled 3-4 players only), expanding access at higher counts
- Solo/2-player: House Hagal adds 2 rival dummy players to simulate blocking
  and Combat competition
- Conflict rewards scale with player count (different reward cards)
- Troop supply limited per player (same across all counts)

### What Makes It #5

The deck-building/worker-placement hybrid. Neither mechanic alone is novel in
2020, but fusing them so that your DECK determines your PLACEMENT options is
genuinely new. Every card acquisition changes not just your hand quality but
your board access. The Conflict escalation gives the game a built-in dramatic
arc — early rounds are engine-building, late rounds are all-in combat for
massive VP swings. The Intrigue card system adds hidden information to what
could be a solvable optimization puzzle. And the Dune IP isn't decorative —
the four factions, spice harvesting, political maneuvering, and desert
warfare all map to real mechanical systems. Dune Imperium plays in 90 minutes
and delivers strategic depth that many 3-hour games can't match.
