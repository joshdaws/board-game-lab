## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Hegemony models the political economy of a modern nation-state by casting each
player as a distinct socioeconomic class: Working Class, Middle Class, Capitalist
Class, or the State. The theme is not a metaphor layered onto abstract mechanics
— it IS the mechanics. Workers are a literal shared resource: the Working Class
controls the labor supply, Capitalists need those workers to operate companies,
the Middle Class employs them in services, and the State must ensure enough
employment and welfare to keep society functional. When the Working Class calls
a strike, workers are physically removed from Capitalist-owned companies,
reducing production. When the State raises taxes, income flows change for every
class. When Capitalists lobby for deregulation, labor protections erode. Every
mechanical interaction maps to a real-world economic relationship, and the
designers have been explicit that this mapping was the starting point, not an
afterthought. The game models left-right political dynamics along multiple
policy axes — Fiscal Policy, Labor Market, Foreign Trade, Immigration,
Healthcare, Education — without moralizing. Progressive and conservative
positions each carry genuine mechanical tradeoffs, and the "correct" policy
depends entirely on which class you represent. This ideological neutrality is
itself a design statement: the system argues that political positions are
rational expressions of class interest, not moral absolutes.

### Core Loop

Each game round follows a structured sequence built around legislation,
action, and economic resolution:

1. PREPARATION PHASE - Each player performs role-specific setup steps: paying
   interest on loans, drawing action cards, gaining new workers, and adjusting
   populations. In 4-player games, the State draws Event cards that present
   societal issues requiring attention. Policy positions on each track (Fiscal,
   Labor, Foreign Trade, Immigration, Healthcare, Education) determine the
   economic rules for the round — tax rates, minimum wages, trade tariffs,
   immigration flow, public service availability.

2. ACTION PHASE - Players take turns playing action cards from their hand. Each
   class has a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT deck of action cards reflecting its unique
   economic role:
   - Working Class: organize labor, call strikes, demand welfare, seek
     employment, protest policies
   - Middle Class: open small businesses, provide services, educate workers,
     navigate between labor and capital
   - Capitalist Class: build companies, hire workers, produce goods, lobby
     for favorable policy, maximize profit extraction
   - State: legislate, tax, fund public services (healthcare, education),
     manage national debt, maintain legitimacy
   Players take turns in fixed order (Working Class, Middle Class, Capitalist
   Class, State) playing one card per turn for 5 turns each, keeping 2 cards
   in hand for the next round. On each turn a player either plays a card for
   its effect (Main Action) or discards it to perform a Basic Action, and may
   also perform one Free Action.

3. PRODUCTION PHASE - Companies produce goods and services based on their
   workforce; workers are paid wages. The people's basic needs (Food) are
   covered, IMF debt limits are checked, and players pay taxes to the State.
   Production order is reversed (State first, then Capitalist, Middle Class,
   Working Class).

4. ELECTIONS PHASE - Proposed Bills (placed during the Action Phase via the
   Propose Bill basic action) are voted on. Each class first refills the voting
   bag with cubes proportional to its power (population, companies, or both),
   then elections are carried out: players declare in favor or against, 5 cubes
   are drawn from the bag, and players may spend Influence to add additional
   votes. The outcome shifts policy tracks, changing economic rules for
   subsequent rounds.

5. SCORING PHASE - Each class scores additional Victory Points based on its
   unique objectives and the state of its player board. The State also resolves
   any unhandled Event penalties. At game end (after round 5), loan penalties
   apply and final scores from the Politics table and player boards are added.

Victory is determined by accumulated class-specific victory points over five
rounds, with each class pursuing fundamentally different scoring criteria.

### Key Design Patterns

RADICAL ASYMMETRY AS IDEOLOGICAL SIMULATION: Hegemony's asymmetry goes beyond
variable player powers — each class plays what amounts to a different game
operating on shared economic infrastructure. The Working Class is playing a
labor organizing game: managing union membership, timing strikes for maximum
leverage, pushing for welfare spending. The Capitalist Class is playing a
production optimization game: building companies, hiring efficiently, lobbying
to reduce labor costs and taxation. The Middle Class occupies a structural
middle ground, running small businesses and services while being squeezed by
both labor and capital. The State is playing a governance simulation: balancing
the budget, funding public services, maintaining legitimacy while being pulled
in opposing directions by every other class. These are not different paths to
the same goal — they are different goals expressed through different mechanics.
A Capitalist player literally cannot perform Working Class actions, and vice
versa. This forces players to understand their class's structural position
within the economy, not just optimize a generic strategy.

POLICY TRACKS AS SHARED RULE MODIFICATION: The six policy tracks function as
living game rules that players collectively negotiate and contest. When the
Fiscal Policy track shifts left, tax rates increase — the State collects more
revenue, Capitalists keep less profit, and public services get more funding.
When the Labor Market track shifts right, worker protections decrease —
Capitalists can hire and fire more freely, but the Working Class loses
bargaining power. These are not minor adjustments; they fundamentally alter
the economic landscape every round. The genius of this system is that "game
balance" is itself a political question. There is no neutral position on the
policy tracks — every configuration advantages some classes and disadvantages
others. Players must engage in political action (voting, lobbying, striking,
legislating) to shape the rules in their favor. The game's rules are, in a
very real sense, up for democratic (and undemocratic) contestation.

WORKERS AS SHARED CONTESTED RESOURCE: In most economic games, workers are an
abstract resource each player generates independently. In Hegemony, workers are
a shared population. The Working Class controls the labor supply — real worker
tokens that must be employed in Capitalist companies or Middle Class businesses
to generate production. This creates genuine interdependence: Capitalists
NEED the Working Class to operate, but the Working Class needs employment to
earn wages. The strike mechanic weaponizes this interdependence. When workers
strike, they are removed from companies, halting production and costing the
Capitalist player revenue. But striking workers also forgo wages, creating
mutual cost. This is a mechanical model of real labor dynamics — the strike
is a weapon of last resort that hurts both sides but disproportionately
pressures capital when timed correctly.

MARKET SIMULATION AS ANTI-SOLITAIRE MECHANISM: The production and market system
prevents any class from playing in isolation. Companies produce goods, but those
goods must be sold into a market with finite, tracked demand. If Capitalists
overproduce, prices fall and goods go unsold. If they underproduce, demand goes
unmet but prices remain high. Foreign trade policy affects whether cheap imports
flood the market (hurting domestic production) or tariffs protect local industry
(raising consumer prices). The market connects every class: Workers earn wages
from employment in companies that must sell goods into a market shaped by State
policy and consumer demand driven partly by Working Class purchasing power.
This circular economic dependency means no player can optimize in isolation —
every decision ripples through the shared economy.

LEGITIMACY AS GOVERNANCE CONSTRAINT: The State player operates under a unique
constraint: legitimacy. Unlike the other classes, which primarily chase their
economic objectives, the State must maintain political legitimacy or face
escalating penalties. Legitimacy drops when public services are underfunded,
when unemployment is too high, when the national debt spirals, or when
governance is perceived as serving one class too blatantly. This mechanic
prevents the State from simply allying with one class and ignoring others.
A State that only serves Capitalist interests will see legitimacy erode as
public services collapse. A State that only serves the Working Class will
face fiscal crisis and capital flight. The legitimacy track forces the State
into the uncomfortable middle — exactly where real governance operates.

VOTING AS WEIGHTED NEGOTIATION: The voting system rejects the fiction of
equal political voice. Votes are weighted by class power, wealth, and
political investment. The Capitalist Class can use lobbying to amplify its
political influence. The Working Class can use collective action and protest
to increase its voice. The State frames the agenda but must navigate the
competing pressures. This weighted voting models the reality that democratic
outcomes are shaped by power imbalances, not just head counts. It also
creates a metagame of political alliance and betrayal: classes may temporarily
align on a policy vote (Capitalists and Working Class might both oppose a
specific State tax proposal for entirely different reasons) before returning
to structural opposition.

IMMIGRATION AND EMIGRATION AS LABOR MARKET LEVER: Immigration policy is not
cosmetic — it mechanically affects the labor supply. Open immigration increases
the worker pool, which benefits Capitalists (more available labor, downward
pressure on wages) and can hurt the Working Class (wage competition). Closed
immigration tightens the labor market, giving the Working Class more
bargaining power but potentially starving companies of workers. Emigration
functions as a pressure valve: if conditions are bad enough, workers leave
the country entirely, shrinking the economy. This mechanical modeling of
migration as an economic variable — not a moral one — is characteristic of
Hegemony's commitment to simulation over editorializing.

### What Makes It #41

Hegemony is the most ambitious political simulation in modern board gaming. Where
most asymmetric games give players different abilities within a shared framework,
Hegemony gives each player a different framework entirely — different actions,
different goals, different economic relationships, different definitions of
winning. The game's central achievement is modeling the structural interdependence
of socioeconomic classes: Capitalists need workers, workers need employment,
the Middle Class needs stability, and the State needs all three to function.
No class can win in isolation, but every class's victory conditions conflict
with at least one other's. The policy track system turns the game's own rules
into contested political terrain, making legislation and voting as
strategically consequential as any economic action. The labor market simulation
— with its strikes, wage negotiations, and employment dynamics — creates
emergent narratives that feel like compressed political history. And the
game accomplishes all of this without taking sides: both progressive and
conservative policies carry genuine mechanical weight, and the "right" answer
depends entirely on your class position. Hegemony's design argues that
political economy is itself a game — one where the rules are written by
the players with the most power to write them.
