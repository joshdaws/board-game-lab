## Design Notes

Designer: Chris Cantrell, Rick Ernst, Stone Librande, Prashant Saraswat & Nathan Tiras. Published by Riot Games (2016).

### Theme Integration

Mechs vs. Minions draws its world from the League of Legends universe but
makes the shrewd design decision to strip away the competitive MOBA framework
and rebuild the IP as a cooperative tabletop experience. Players control
yordle pilots — Tristana, Corki, Heimerdinger, and Ziggs — each manning a
mechanical combat suit. The theme is not about the lore of Runeterra; it is
about the chaotic, often hilarious experience of piloting a jury-rigged mech
through waves of swarming minions. The mech fantasy is the whole game: you
build your command line card by card, watch it execute in sequence, and then
deal with the consequences when a damage card rotates your steering or
replaces a carefully placed ability with junk. The minions arrive in waves
dictated by scenario-specific spawn rules, and their relentless advance gives
the cooperative threat a physical, spatial presence on the board. Everything
on the table — the oversized mech miniatures, the chunky metal gears on the
command line boards, the thick cardboard modular tiles — reinforces the
feeling of piloting a machine that is powerful but only barely under your
control.

The campaign structure amplifies the thematic arc. Early missions feel like
training exercises: move here, stomp these minions, survive. Later missions
introduce bombs, teleporters, boss-scale threats, and multi-objective
coordination. The narrative is light by campaign game standards — a few
paragraphs per mission envelope — but the escalating mechanical complexity
serves as its own storytelling. By mission ten, your command line is a
six-card engine of destruction, and the game asks you to wield it with
precision against scenarios that punish any misalignment. The gap between
your intent and your mech's execution IS the comedy, and that gap is a
deliberate design choice rooted in the programming genre's oldest insight:
plans are funny when they go wrong.

### Core Loop

Each mission follows a structured round sequence with a Player Phase
followed by a Minion Phase:

PLAYER PHASE:
1. DRAFT COMMAND CARDS — 5 command cards are drawn from the deck and
   placed face-up. Starting with the first player, each player drafts
   one card in clockwise order until 4 cards have been picked (with
   fewer than 4 players, some players draft multiple cards). The
   remaining card is discarded. Cards come in four elements (Fire,
   Electric, Metal, Computery) and include movement, turning, and
   attack types.

2. PLAY COMMAND CARDS — All players simultaneously slot their drafted
   cards into one of six numbered slots on their command line. Cards
   cannot be saved; all must be slotted. Cards of the same element can
   stack (up to 3 deep) in a single slot, with the top card's ability
   executing at power equal to the stack's total card count.

3. EXECUTE COMMAND LINES — Starting with the first player, each player
   executes their command line from slot 1 through slot 6. Each occupied
   slot triggers its top card's ability. Empty slots are skipped.
   Execution is mandatory and sequential.

MINION PHASE (once all missions introduce minions):
4. MINION MOVEMENT — Minions move according to the Rune Die roll and
   Crystal Compass direction. Minions cannot move into occupied spaces
   or push mechs.

5. SPAWN NEW MINIONS — New minions appear at designated locations based
   on the current scenario's spawn rules.

6. MINIONS ATTACK — Each minion adjacent to a mech deals 1 damage.
   For each damage taken, a Damage Card is drawn. Damage cards may be
   Glitch (immediate one-time effect), System (ongoing effect), or Slot
   damage (placed into a command line slot, corrupting it). Damage is
   not health loss — it is command corruption.

### Key Design Patterns

ACTION PROGRAMMING AS COMMAND QUEUE: The command line is the game's central
innovation and its deepest source of both strategy and comedy. Rather than
choosing actions each turn, you build a persistent program that executes
identically every round until modified. Slot 1 always fires before slot 2;
slot 6 always fires last. The sequential nature means card placement is
spatial reasoning: a turn card in slot 3 reorients your mech BEFORE the
attack card in slot 4 fires, changing the attack's direction. A movement
card in slot 1 repositions you before everything else resolves. The command
line transforms action selection from a per-turn decision into a persistent
architecture that you refine over the course of a mission. Early rounds are
about building the skeleton; late rounds are about living with what you built.

DAMAGE AS COMMAND CORRUPTION: Most cooperative games track health — take
enough hits and you're eliminated. Mechs vs. Minions rejects this entirely.
Damage cards are inserted INTO your command line, corrupting your program.
A damage card might rotate the top card of a slot 90 degrees (changing its
directional output), replace an ability with a malfunction, or force a
random slot rearrangement. The effect is that damage degrades your
capabilities in unpredictable, often darkly funny ways: your mech now turns
left when it should go straight, or fires its flamethrower backward into an
ally. This design choice means damage is recoverable (you can draft over
corrupted slots), creates emergent narrative (the "broken mech" comedy),
and avoids player elimination entirely. No one sits out — they just pilot
an increasingly unreliable machine.

DRAFT-BASED PROGRAMMING: The card draft is where cooperative negotiation
meets individual optimization. With exactly one card per player each round,
the draft forces genuine sacrifice — someone must take the card their
program does not need because another player needs the remaining options
more. The draft order rotates, so no single player consistently gets first
pick. The limited supply also means your ideal command line is unreachable;
you build the best program the draft allows, not the one you planned.
This constraint prevents the "alpha player" problem common in cooperative
games because no one can dictate another player's program when the draft
itself limits everyone's options.

COOPERATIVE PROGRAMMING WITH FRIENDLY FIRE RISK: Because command lines
execute sequentially (first player through last) and mechs share the same board, positional
coordination is critical. A flamethrower fires in a line from your mech's
facing — if an ally is in that line, they take damage. A Scythe card
damages everything adjacent, including friendly mechs. Movement cards can
leave you blocking a corridor your ally needed to traverse. The cooperative
challenge is not just "beat the minions" but "execute four independent
programs on the same board without destroying each other." This spatial
interdependency is where the game's real strategic depth lives, demanding
turn-order reasoning and facing awareness that the weight rating of 2.42
significantly understates.

CAMPAIGN AS TUTORIAL STRUCTURE: The ten-mission campaign is not a
branching narrative — it is a masterfully paced tutorial disguised as a
story. Mission 1 introduces movement and basic combat. Mission 2 adds
the draft. Mission 3 introduces stacking. Later missions layer in bosses,
environmental hazards, multi-objective coordination, and advanced damage
types. Each mission envelope contains new components (tokens, tiles,
scenario-specific rules) that are added permanently to the game. The
campaign never requires players to remember rules from five missions ago
because each mission's rules card contains everything needed. This
structure means you can teach Mechs vs. Minions by opening the box —
the game teaches itself. The designers understood that accessibility is
a design statement, not a concession, and that the widest possible
audience is reached by front-loading simplicity and back-loading depth.

PRODUCTION QUALITY AS DESIGN STATEMENT: Riot Games sold Mechs vs. Minions
at cost (approximately $75 for a box containing over 100 miniatures, a
metal-geared command board, painted components, and a full campaign). The
production quality is not incidental to the design — it IS part of the
design. The oversized miniatures make the board readable at a glance. The
metal gears on the command line boards make card placement tactile and
satisfying. The painted minions eliminate the hobby barrier that keeps
many players from miniature-heavy games. The individually sealed mission
envelopes create anticipation and pacing. Riot understood that the
physical experience of a board game is a design surface, not just a
manufacturing decision. The lavish production also served a strategic
goal: it announced Riot as a serious tabletop publisher and generated
enormous word-of-mouth from a community accustomed to paying twice the
price for half the components.

ESCALATING MINION WAVES AS TIMER: The minion spawn system creates
urgency without a literal countdown track. Each round, new minions
appear and existing minions advance. If they reach a threshold or
overrun a critical position, the mission fails. The spawn rate
typically accelerates across rounds (later spawn cards add more minions
or spawn from additional entry points), creating a mounting pressure
curve. This design means the team cannot turtle — they must solve the
scenario's puzzle before the board state becomes unrecoverable. The
minion wave also creates spatial pressure, herding mechs toward or
away from specific board regions and forcing reactive program
adjustments. The timer is thematic (the minions are swarming!) rather
than abstract (move a token on a track), which preserves immersion
while serving the same mechanical purpose.

STACKING AS POWER SCALING: The command line stacking mechanic elegantly
solves the power curve problem. Rather than introducing new, more
powerful cards as the mission progresses, the same cards become
stronger when stacked. A Ripsaw dealing one damage becomes a Ripsaw
dealing three damage when stacked three deep (the maximum). This means early-game
cards remain relevant, the draft stays meaningful throughout (even
duplicate cards are valuable for stacking), and power growth is
player-directed rather than deck-driven. Stacking also creates
interesting decisions about depth versus breadth: do you stack a
single devastating attack in one slot, or spread abilities across
multiple slots for flexibility? Deep stacks are powerful but fragile
— a single damage card corrupting that slot wipes out your investment.

### What Makes It #86

Mechs vs. Minions proves that cooperative programming can be accessible,
hilarious, and strategically satisfying simultaneously. The command line
system is genuinely novel — building a persistent program that degrades
under fire creates a unique design space no other cooperative game
occupies. The campaign-as-tutorial structure makes a game with real
strategic depth playable by families on the first night. And the
production quality set a new standard for what a board game box can
contain. At a weight of 2.42, it occupies a rare position: light enough
for casual groups, deep enough that experienced players discover
positional optimization and draft strategy across repeated plays. It is
the definitive argument that programming games do not need to be punishing
to be engaging.
