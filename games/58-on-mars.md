## Design Notes

Designer: Vital Lacerda. Published by Eagle-Gryphon Games (2020).

### Theme Integration

On Mars is Vital Lacerda's most thematically ambitious design, and the theme is not
a veneer over mechanical abstraction. It is the structural logic of the entire system.
Players are astronaut-engineers participating in the colonization of Mars, and every
major mechanical system maps to a real challenge of planetary settlement. The dual
action spaces, orbit and surface, represent the genuine logistical division between
a space station in orbit and a colony on the ground. The shuttle that ferries players
between these two locations is not a game mechanism wearing a thematic costume; it is
the expression of a fundamental constraint of space colonization: you cannot be in
two places at once, and transit has a cost.

The blueprint-to-building pipeline captures the reality that Martian construction
requires planning, resource gathering, and execution as distinct phases. You do not
simply place a building; you acquire its blueprint in orbit, gather resources on the
surface, and then construct it in a specific location within the colony grid. The
Life Support System (LSS) tracks represent shared colony infrastructure, power
generation, water extraction, plant cultivation, and oxygen production, that all
players contribute to and depend upon. Neglecting these
systems harms everyone; advancing them helps the colony but may or may not serve your
individual scoring objectives. This tension between collective survival and individual
achievement is the thematic heart of the game.

Lacerda's research into actual Mars colonization proposals, including NASA's plans and
SpaceX's early Starship concepts, is evident in the game's systems. The technology
tracks reflect real engineering priorities. The resource types correspond to actual
Martian challenges. The colony layout follows plausible settlement patterns. On Mars
does not simulate Mars colonization with scientific accuracy, but it engages with the
subject matter seriously enough that the theme shapes every decision a player makes.
You are not playing an abstract optimization puzzle that happens to be set on Mars;
you are problem-solving the colonization of another planet, and the problems feel
genuine.

### Core Loop

On Mars operates on a round structure governed by the shuttle's orbit-to-surface
cycle, with players choosing their location strategically:

1. CHOOSE LOCATION - At the start of each round, players decide whether to be in
   orbit (the space station) or on the surface (the Mars colony). The shuttle travels
   between these locations on a fixed schedule, and players may ride it when it
   departs. This binary choice defines your available actions for the round: orbit
   and surface offer completely different action menus.

2. ORBITAL ACTIONS - Players in orbit access the space station, where they can:
   acquire blueprints for buildings, develop technologies on the tech tracks,
   conduct research and development, and access Earth-sourced supplies through
   resupply. Orbit is the planning and acquisition phase.

3. SURFACE ACTIONS - Players on the surface access the Mars colony, where they can:
   construct buildings (using acquired blueprints and resources), upgrade buildings,
   upgrade the LSS infrastructure, hire scientists, take Earth contracts, and use
   the control center to deploy bots and rovers. Surface is the execution and
   production phase.

4. EXECUTIVE ACTION - After taking their main action, players may perform one
   executive action: a secondary action that costs additional resources or occupies
   a specific slot. Executive actions allow players to accomplish more per round
   but at premium cost, creating an efficiency optimization layer.

5. COLONY MANAGEMENT - Buildings constructed on the surface produce resources,
   advance technology, or provide special abilities. The colony grid creates spatial
   relationships between buildings: adjacency matters for activation bonuses and
   area majority scoring. The LSS tracks advance as players build life support
   infrastructure, unlocking colony-wide milestones.

6. SHUTTLE PHASE - The shuttle moves between orbit and surface on a predictable
   schedule. Players on the shuttle's departure location may ride it to the other
   location for free; otherwise, they remain where they are. The shuttle's schedule
   creates a tempo constraint that forces players to plan multiple rounds ahead.

### Key Design Patterns

SPATIAL DUALITY AS ACTION PARTITIONING: On Mars' most distinctive design contribution
is the hard separation of actions into two physical locations with controlled transit
between them. Orbit actions (acquire blueprints, develop tech, take contracts) are
fundamentally different from surface actions (build, mine, upgrade LSS). This is not
a cosmetic distinction; it creates genuine planning depth because resources acquired
in orbit must be transported to the surface for use, and surface production cannot be
easily leveraged for orbital opportunities. The shuttle schedule adds temporal
pressure: if you miss the shuttle, you are stuck in your current location for an
additional round. This spatial-temporal constraint system is what gives On Mars its
distinctive strategic texture, the feeling of managing logistics across a supply chain
that spans two locations.

SHUTTLE AS TEMPO MECHANISM: The shuttle's fixed schedule between orbit and surface
creates a metronomic rhythm that all players must synchronize with. Unlike worker
placement games where action access is purely competitive, On Mars layers location
access over a temporal grid. Planning when to ride the shuttle, and when to stay put
and maximize your current location, is a meta-decision that sits above individual
action selection. The shuttle turns a simple "choose your actions" framework into a
multi-round planning puzzle where timing matters as much as selection.

BLUEPRINT-TO-BUILDING PIPELINE: Construction in On Mars is not a single action but
a multi-step process: acquire a blueprint in orbit, gather the required resources on
the surface, and then execute the build action in a specific colony grid location.
This pipeline design serves multiple purposes. Thematically, it mirrors the planning
reality of extraplanetary construction. Mechanically, it creates forward planning
pressure, since players must commit to a building several rounds before they can
complete it. Strategically, it enables disruption, because the resources or grid
positions you are planning around may be claimed by opponents during the intervening
rounds.

SHARED COLONY INFRASTRUCTURE (LSS): The Life Support System tracks, representing
power generation, water extraction, plant cultivation, and oxygen production, are
collectively managed resources that all players contribute to and benefit from. Advancing an LSS track helps the entire
colony reach milestones, which unlock bonuses for everyone. This creates a social
dilemma at the heart of the game: investing in LSS helps your opponents as much as
it helps you, but neglecting it slows colony progress and delays milestones you need.
Lacerda uses this shared infrastructure to create a cooperative tension within a
competitive framework, mirroring the real dynamic of a colony where individual
ambition must coexist with collective survival.

INTERLOCKING SYSTEM DENSITY: On Mars is the most mechanically dense game in
Lacerda's catalog, and this density is deliberate. Every system connects to at least
two others: technology tracks unlock building capabilities, buildings produce
resources needed for other buildings, LSS advancement requires specific building
types, contracts require specific technology levels, and scientists modify the costs
and benefits of all of the above. This interlocking density means that improving
one capability ripples across multiple systems, creating a web of indirect
consequences that rewards holistic strategic thinking over local optimization.

AREA MAJORITY ON THE COLONY GRID: The Mars surface is a grid where building
placement determines area majority scoring. Each sector of the grid is contested, and
the player with the most buildings in a sector scores bonus points. This spatial
competition layer sits on top of the resource and pipeline systems, adding a
positional dimension to construction decisions. Where you build matters as much as
what you build, and the optimal grid position for area majority may conflict with
the optimal position for adjacency bonuses. This spatial tension prevents players
from treating construction as a pure engine-building exercise.

TECHNOLOGY AS GATING MECHANISM: The tech tracks in On Mars serve as prerequisites
for advanced buildings and actions. Unlike tech trees that simply provide bonuses,
Lacerda's tech tracks gate access to entire categories of construction and
production. A player who neglects technology development will find themselves unable
to build the highest-scoring structures, regardless of their resource stockpile. This
gating creates strategic commitment: you must decide early which technology paths to
pursue, and those commitments shape the rest of your game. The tech tracks also
interact with scientists (who modify tech costs) and contracts (which require specific
tech levels), deepening the commitment dynamics.

CONTRACTS AS ENDGAME STEERING: Contracts acquired in orbit define end-game scoring
objectives, and their availability is limited. Early contract acquisition lets players
shape their entire strategy around specific scoring goals, but committing to a
contract early means investing actions in orbit that could have been spent on surface
production. Late contract acquisition risks finding that the contracts aligned with
your strategy have been taken by opponents. This timing tension around contracts
creates a meta-strategic layer: when to commit to a scoring plan is as important as
what plan to commit to.

### What Makes It #58

On Mars is Lacerda's most structurally ambitious design, and its defining quality is
the feeling of managing a genuine logistical operation across two physically separated
locations. The shuttle tempo mechanism, the blueprint pipeline, the shared LSS
infrastructure, and the colony grid area majority system combine to create an
experience that is less "playing a board game" and more "solving a colonization
problem." The 4.67 weight is earned: every decision reverberates through multiple
interlocking systems, and the spatial-temporal constraint of the orbit/surface duality
ensures that even experienced players must plan several rounds ahead. On Mars is not
a game for everyone, but for players who crave systemic density and thematic
integration at the highest weight class, it delivers an experience that no other
design replicates.
