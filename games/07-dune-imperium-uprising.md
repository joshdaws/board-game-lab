## Design Notes

Designer: Paul Dennen. Published by Dire Wolf Digital (2023).

### Theme Integration

Uprising shifts the Dune timeline forward from the original game. The Emperor
has betrayed House Atreides, Muad'Dib has risen among the Fremen, and the
conflict on Arrakis has escalated from a blood feud between rival Houses into
a galaxy-spanning uprising. The mechanical additions map directly to this
narrative escalation: sandworms can now be summoned as combat units (the Fremen
have learned to ride them), Spies infiltrate board spaces through observation
posts (reflecting the espionage that pervades Herbert's universe), the Shield
Wall can be destroyed to open new strategic possibilities, and CHOAM contracts
represent the commercial empire that spans the Imperium. The same six factions
return (Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, Fremen, plus Landsraad and
populated areas of Dune), but the board geography emphasizes the desert
wilderness and the strategic importance of spice harvesting sites.

### Core Loop

Same five-phase round structure as the base Dune: Imperium, with key additions:

1. ROUND START - Reveal a new Conflict card (escalating Tier I/II/III). Each
   player draws 5 cards from their personal deck.
2. PLAYER TURNS - Players alternate taking turns. Two turn types:
   a) AGENT TURN - Play a card from hand, send an Agent to a matching board
      space (card must have a matching Agent icon). Gain board space rewards
      AND card's Agent box effects. Recruit troops, deploy to Conflict,
      summon sandworms, place Spies on observation posts.
   b) REVEAL TURN - When out of Agents or choosing to stop. Reveal remaining
      hand, gain Persuasion (to buy cards) and sword icons (combat strength).
      Set total combat strength on the Combat track.
3. COMBAT - Play Combat Intrigue cards, then resolve. Highest strength wins
   first reward from the Conflict card; second and third places get lesser
   rewards. Winner takes Conflict card (for battle icon matching). Sandworms
   DOUBLE combat rewards.
4. MAKERS - Unoccupied desert spaces with Maker icons gain 1 bonus spice each.
   Spice accumulates until harvested.
5. RECALL - Check for 10+ VP or empty Conflict deck (triggers Endgame). If
   not, recall Agents, pass First Player marker clockwise.

Win condition: First to 10 VP (or most VP at Endgame). Tiebreakers: spice,
Solari, water, garrisoned troops.

### Key Design Patterns

SANDWORMS AS COMBAT UNITS: The headline addition. Whenever a sandworm icon
appears on a card or board space, you summon a sandworm from the bank and
deploy it directly to the Conflict (never to your garrison). Sandworms are
worth 3 strength each (vs. 2 for troops). But the real power is REWARD
DOUBLING: if you have one or more sandworms in the Conflict when rewards are
distributed, you DOUBLE most rewards you receive (can't double location control
or battle icons). This creates an entirely new strategic axis — a player with
fewer troops but a sandworm can outvalue a larger army. Two restrictions gate
sandworm access: you usually need a Maker Hooks token (obtained at Sietch Tabr)
and sandworms can't be summoned to Conflicts protected by the Shield Wall.
Destroying the Shield Wall (via specific card effects) opens all Conflicts to
sandworm deployment, making it a pivotal game moment.

SHIELD WALL DESTRUCTION: The Shield Wall token protects three critical
locations (Arrakeen, Spice Refinery, Imperial Basin) from sandworm summoning.
Specific cards and board space effects include a Shield Wall detonation icon
that lets you remove this token permanently. Once destroyed, sandworms can be
summoned to ANY Conflict — dramatically shifting the power balance toward
Fremen-aligned strategies and players who've invested in Maker Hooks. The
decision to destroy the Shield Wall is a game-defining moment: it helps
sandworm-focused players but also opens up sandworm possibilities for everyone.

SPY NETWORK SYSTEM: Three Spies per player, placed on observation posts
scattered across the board. Observation posts connect to one or more board
spaces. Spies enable two powerful actions when recalled: INFILTRATE (recall a
Spy to send your Agent to a board space already occupied by another player's
Agent, bypassing the normal one-Agent-per-space restriction) or GATHER
INTELLIGENCE (recall a Spy when sending an Agent to a connected space to draw
a card before resolving any effects). The Spy Agent icon lets you send an
Agent to any board space connected to an observation post where you have a Spy.
This system adds hidden tactical options — your opponents can see your Spies
but don't know when you'll recall them or which ability you'll use. Spies
create a persistent board presence between rounds, unlike Agents which recall
every round.

BATTLE ICON MATCHING: When you win a Conflict, you take the Conflict card
face-up into your supply. Three battle icons exist (Crysknife, Desert Mouse,
Ornithopter). If you have another face-up Conflict card or Objective card with
a matching battle icon, you flip the matching pair face-down and gain 1 VP.
At Endgame, a wild battle icon on one of the three icons lets you match any
pair. This creates a secondary scoring system tied to WHICH Conflicts you win,
not just winning frequently. It incentivizes strategic target selection —
sometimes the second-best Conflict reward is worth pursuing if the battle icon
completes a match.

ACQUIRE EFFECTS: Some Imperium cards have a special Acquire box below their
normal effects. When you purchase this card (via Persuasion during your Reveal
turn), you immediately gain the Acquire effect — a one-time bonus at the moment
of purchase. This is new to Uprising and adds a timing dimension to deck-
building: the card's Acquire effect triggers now, but the card itself won't
be playable until it cycles through your deck. It rewards buying cards early
when the Acquire bonus is most valuable.

CHOAM MODULE (INCLUDED MINI-EXPANSION): Adds 20 contract tokens, the Shaddam
Corrino IV leader, and additional Imperium/Intrigue cards. Contracts are taken
from face-up slots on the board and completed by fulfilling specific conditions
(sending an Agent to a named space, harvesting a certain amount of spice,
acquiring The Spice Must Flow). Completed contracts reward resources and VP.
The module adds a parallel objective system — contracts give you short-term
goals beyond the Conflict cycle, rewarding players who diversify their
Agent placements rather than focusing solely on combat.

INFLUENCE TRACK REFINEMENTS: The four-faction Influence system returns with
clearer thresholds. At 2 Influence: gain 1 VP (lose it if you drop below 2).
At 4 Influence: earn the bonus printed on that space. The FIRST player to
reach 4 Influence with a faction claims the Alliance token (worth the VP
printed on it). If another player passes you on the track, you LOSE the
Alliance token and its VP — they take both. This stealing mechanic creates
races on each track and defensive play to maintain leads. Reaching 2 Influence
also unlocks faction-gated board spaces (Imperial Privilege, Shipping, Sietch
Tabr) and powers up certain Imperium cards.

EIGHT AGENT ICONS: Uprising expands the Agent icon vocabulary to eight types:
Emperor, Spacing Guild, Bene Gesserit, Fremen, Landsraad, City, Spice Trade,
and Spy. Cards in your deck provide access to specific icon types, determining
which board spaces you can visit. The Spy icon is entirely new — it lets you
send an Agent to any space connected to an observation post where you have a
Spy. This expanded icon set means deck-building requires more deliberate
faction-access planning than the original game.

SWORDMASTER (THIRD AGENT): You start with 2 Agents. Your third Agent (the
Swordmaster) sits on the board at setup and can be recruited by sending an
Agent to the Swordmaster board space. Gaining your third Agent is a tempo
investment — you spend one of your 2 Agent turns this round to gain a permanent
extra Agent for all future rounds. In a ~10 round game, the earlier you recruit
the Swordmaster, the more total actions you get.

WATER AS THIRD RESOURCE: Alongside Solari (money) and Spice, water functions
as a premium resource. Each player starts with 1 water. Several key board
spaces cost water to access (Desert Tactics costs 1 water). Water is scarcer
than Solari and spice, making it a bottleneck resource that gates access to
powerful Fremen-aligned actions.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1-2 players: Separate Rivals supplement adds automated opponents
- 3-4 players: Standard game. In 4-player games, Score markers start at 1
  (not 0) to compensate for reduced combat opportunities per player
- 5-6 players: Separate Six-Player Games supplement with additional components
- Conflict deck: 1 Conflict I + 5 Conflict II + 4 Conflict III = 10 cards
  (remaining cards returned to box, creating uncertainty about which rewards
  will appear)
- Board is two-sided (for expansion compatibility)
- Objective cards filtered by player count (marked 1-3P or 4/6P)

### What Makes It #7

Uprising is the base Dune: Imperium with its three biggest weaknesses
addressed. Sandworms add a combat dimension that rewards strategic investment
over raw troop count. Spies eliminate the frustration of getting blocked from
key board spaces — if you've placed your Spies well, you always have options.
Battle icon matching gives Conflict victories secondary value beyond immediate
rewards, creating collection incentives that shape which fights you pursue.
The CHOAM module adds a contract system that rewards diverse play patterns.
And the Acquire effects on new cards make deck-building decisions more tactically
immediate. It's the same elegant deck-building-meets-worker-placement core that
made #5 work, but with deeper strategic layers and fewer feel-bad moments. The
sandworm reward doubling alone transforms the combat calculus — sometimes one
sandworm is worth more than five troops.
