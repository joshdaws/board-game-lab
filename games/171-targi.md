### Theme Integration

Targi casts two players as rival Tuareg nobles trading goods across the
Saharan desert. The border of the game board represents the perimeter of a
desert trading post, with permanent action spaces arranged around the edges
like market stalls and caravansaries lining a town square. The interior of
this square is a shifting grid of resource and tribe cards that represent
the temporary opportunities available at the trading post on any given day.
The Tuareg people historically controlled trans-Saharan trade routes, and
the game captures this identity through its focus on accumulating goods --
dates, salt, pepper, and gold -- and converting them into tribal alliances.
Players are not exploring or conquering; they are brokering, collecting,
and building influence through commerce.

The robber figure that moves around the perimeter one space per round
represents the constant threat of desert raiders disrupting trade. When the
robber reaches a corner, a raid occurs and players must pay tribute or
suffer losses. This creates a rhythmic tension tied to the desert setting:
the trading post is not a safe haven but a place of calculated risk, where
commerce happens in the windows between raids. The four corners of the
board are raid spaces, and the distance between them creates a predictable
but inescapable countdown that shapes every decision. The desert is not
just backdrop -- it is a timer.

The tribe cards themselves carry the weight of thematic expression. Each
depicts a member of the Tuareg community -- craftsmen, elders, merchants,
warriors -- and provides either an immediate effect or an ongoing ability.
Building your tableau of tribe cards feels like assembling a community of
allies, each contributing a distinct skill to your trading operation. The
set collection bonuses for arranging tribes in specific patterns reflect
the idea that a well-organized community is greater than the sum of its
parts. The game treats tribal affiliation not as military might but as
social capital: your power comes from whom you know and how their skills
complement each other.

### Core Loop

The game is played over a series of rounds until either all four corner
raid spaces have been activated or a player completes their 3x4 tribe
tableau. Each round follows a structured sequence:

1. ROBBER MOVEMENT - Move the robber figure one space clockwise along the
   border. If the robber reaches a corner space, a raid occurs immediately:
   each player must pay a specified resource or lose victory points. The
   robber's position also blocks one border action space each round,
   removing it from consideration during worker placement.

2. WORKER PLACEMENT - Players alternate placing their three Targi workers
   on border action spaces. Each player has three worker meeples. Border
   spaces provide specific actions: gain one of the four goods (dates,
   salt, pepper, gold), gain victory points, draw tribe cards, take a
   noble action, or perform trade. Players cannot place workers on corner
   spaces, on the space occupied by the robber, or directly opposite an
   opponent's worker. This opposition rule is the game's core blocking
   mechanism -- by placing on one edge, you deny your opponent the
   corresponding space across the board.

3. INTERSECTION MARKING - After all six workers are placed (three per
   player), each player places intersection markers at the grid coordinates
   where imaginary lines extending from their border workers cross. With
   three border workers, each player receives up to three intersection
   points in the interior grid. These intersection markers grant access to
   the goods cards or tribe cards at those grid positions.

4. ACTION RESOLUTION - Players take turns resolving their claimed spaces.
   Border spaces grant their printed action. Intersection spaces grant the
   card at that position: goods cards provide resources, tribe cards can
   be purchased and added to the player's tableau by paying their resource
   cost.

5. TRIBE PLACEMENT - Purchased tribe cards are placed into the player's
   personal 3x4 tableau grid. Placement position matters for end-game
   set collection bonuses: rows and columns of matching or fully diverse
   tribe symbols score additional points. Some tribes provide immediate
   one-time effects; others grant permanent abilities that modify future
   rounds.

6. GRID REFRESH - Fill any empty interior grid spaces with cards from the
   draw pile, restoring the 3x3 interior to a full display for the next
   round.

### Key Design Patterns

INTERSECTION WORKER PLACEMENT: Targi's signature innovation is that workers
placed on the border indirectly claim interior grid spaces through their
intersections. With three workers on the border, each player projects lines
into the interior, and the crossing points determine which interior cards
they access. This means every border placement serves dual purpose: it
claims the border action AND influences which interior cards you can reach.
Players must think in two dimensions simultaneously, optimizing both the
border actions they need and the interior cards they want. This coordinate-
based system creates a spatial puzzle unlike any other worker placement
game, where the value of a placement depends not only on the space itself
but on its relationship to your other workers.

OPPOSITION BLOCKING: The rule that prevents players from placing directly
opposite an opponent's worker transforms the standard worker-placement
blocking mechanic into something more nuanced. In a typical worker
placement game, you block by occupying the space your opponent wants. In
Targi, you block by occupying the space opposite what they want -- a less
intuitive but more strategically rich constraint. This means defensive
placement requires spatial reasoning about your opponent's likely
intersection targets, not just their desired border actions. The opposition
rule ensures that blocking is never free: placing a worker to deny your
opponent a specific intersection also commits you to a specific border
action and shifts your own intersection geometry.

ROBBER AS PREDICTABLE COUNTDOWN: The robber moves one space clockwise
each round, creating a fully predictable timer. Players always know when
the next raid will occur and can plan their resource management accordingly.
This eliminates the frustration of random disruption events while
preserving the tension of an approaching deadline. The robber also blocks
one border space per round, removing a different option from the placement
pool in a predictable rotation. The countdown creates natural game phases:
the rounds between raids feel like economic sprints where players race to
convert goods into tribe cards before the next tribute is demanded.

TABLEAU SET COLLECTION: The 3x4 tribe tableau combines spatial placement
with set collection in a way that creates compounding decision tension.
Each new tribe card must be placed in the next available position in a
specific row, but which row you choose affects multiple scoring axes:
rows of identical tribe symbols score bonuses, as do columns and diagonals
of complete diversity. Early placements constrain later options, meaning
that a tribe card's value depends not just on its printed ability but on
how it fits into your emerging tableau geometry. This transforms what
could be simple resource-conversion into a spatial optimization puzzle
with long-term consequences.

GOODS-TO-TRIBES CONVERSION ECONOMY: The economic core of Targi is
converting four goods types into tribe cards with varying costs. Gold
serves as a universal wild resource but is scarcer than the other three,
creating a natural tension between flexibility and availability. The
conversion is gated by the intersection system: you cannot simply buy
whatever tribe card you want, because your worker placement determines
which cards you can access. This means the economy is not purely about
accumulation but about timing -- having the right goods when the right
tribe card appears at an accessible intersection. Resource management
and spatial planning are inseparable.

TWO-PLAYER PURITY: Targi is designed exclusively for two players, and this
constraint shapes every system. The opposition blocking rule, the
intersection geometry, and the tight resource economy all depend on exactly
two sets of three workers creating exactly two sets of intersection points
on a shared grid. The game would not function at other player counts, and
this specificity allows Steiger to calibrate interaction, tension, and
pacing with a precision impossible in variable-player-count designs. Every
system in Targi assumes and exploits the symmetry and intimacy of a
two-player contest, making it one of the purest expressions of head-to-head
strategic gaming in the medium-weight category.

### What Makes It #171

Targi earns its place through the intersection mechanic -- a genuine
innovation in worker placement that has been widely admired but rarely
replicated. The idea that workers on the perimeter indirectly claim
resources in the interior creates a spatial reasoning challenge that
elevates a medium-weight game into something with surprising strategic
depth. Combined with the opposition blocking rule, the predictable robber
timer, and the tableau set collection, Targi delivers a tightly interlocked
two-player experience where every placement ripples through multiple
systems. It proves that worker placement does not require heavy economic
simulation to produce deep decisions -- a 60-minute game with three workers
per player can generate more interesting placement puzzles than games with
twice the components and three times the playtime. Its enduring popularity
as the gold standard of two-player worker placement games reflects the
elegance of its core insight: that indirect claiming through spatial
intersection is a richer design space than direct occupation.
