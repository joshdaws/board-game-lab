### Theme Integration

Two rival civilizations of antiquity compete across three ages to
build the greatest city. The theme is lighter than simulation-heavy
games — you are drafting "buildings" represented by cards rather
than placing structures on a map — but it works because every card
type maps to a recognizable pillar of ancient civilization. Brown
and grey cards are raw materials and manufactured goods (the
economic foundation). Blue civic buildings generate culture.
Green scientific buildings drive discovery. Red military buildings
project force. Yellow commercial buildings grease the wheels of
trade. The Wonders — Pyramids, Colossus, Hanging Gardens — are
aspirational landmarks that provide powerful one-shot effects,
grounding the abstract card play in a shared cultural vocabulary.
The military track physically represents a tug-of-war between two
cities, with the Conflict pawn marching toward one capital or the
other. The Herodotus quote on page 2 ("The beginning does not
hint at the end") sets the tone: this is a game about civilizations
whose fates remain uncertain until the final card is played.

### Core Loop

Three Ages, each using 20 cards arranged in a unique pyramid
structure. Per turn, the active player:

1. CHOOSE an accessible card from the pyramid display
2. USE that card in one of three ways:
   a. Construct the Building (pay its resource/coin cost)
   b. Discard it for coins (2 + 1 per yellow card you own)
   c. Tuck it under a Wonder to build that Wonder
3. REVEAL any newly uncovered face-down cards

After all 20 cards are taken, the Age ends. The militarily weaker
player chooses who starts the next Age. After Age III (or upon a
supremacy victory), the game ends.

### Key Design Patterns

CARD PYRAMID AS INFORMATION GRADIENT: The defining
mechanism. Each Age arranges 20 cards in a layered structure
where some cards are face-up (known) and others face-down
(unknown). A card is only "accessible" when no other cards
overlap it. This creates a cascading reveal: taking a visible card
may expose one or two hidden cards beneath it. The three Age
structures are deliberately different — Age I is a broad triangle
(rows of 2-4-6-6-2), Age II an inverted shape, Age III a diamond
with separated columns. The designers use this to control
information density and pacing. Early in each Age you choose from
known options; as you dig deeper, you gamble on what lies beneath.
The face-down cards inject controlled randomness into a
fundamentally strategic game. You can see the overall shape of
what remains but not the specifics, creating a partial-information
puzzle that rewards adaptability over rigid planning.

THREE VICTORY CONDITIONS AS STRATEGIC TENSION: The game
can end three ways: Military Supremacy (push the Conflict pawn
to the opponent's capital), Scientific Supremacy (collect 6 of 7
different science symbols), or Civilian Victory (most points after
Age III). This is not just variety — it is the game's central balancing
mechanism. A player pursuing pure points must constantly monitor
the military track and the opponent's science collection. Ignoring
either threat means risking an instant loss. The supremacy paths
act as strategic constraints that force defensive drafting. Taking a
card you do not need — purely to deny your opponent a sixth
science symbol or a third shield — is often the optimal play. The
civilian path is the "default" ending, but the threat of the other
two keeps every turn urgent.

WONDER DRAFTING AS ASYMMETRIC SETUP: Before the game
begins, 8 of 12 Wonders are drafted in a 1-2-2-2-1 pattern across
two rounds of four. This front-loads strategic commitment and
guarantees asymmetry. Each Wonder has a unique power: The
Appian Way gives coins and steals from the opponent; The Sphinx
and Hanging Gardens grant extra turns; The Mausoleum lets you
build from the discard pile; The Great Library retrieves discarded
Progress tokens. Only 7 total Wonders may be built in a game
(the 8th is removed when the 7th is constructed), creating a race
for tempo. The draft also provides replayability — from 12 Wonders
choose 8, yielding 495 possible Wonder pools before the draft
even begins.

RESOURCE CHAINS AND TRADING WITH THE BANK: Resources
are persistent — once you build a brown or grey card, you produce
that resource permanently. But you can always buy missing
resources from the bank at a cost of 2 coins plus the number of
matching resource symbols your opponent produces. This makes
your opponent's economic engine work against you: if they have
three stone-producing cards, buying stone costs you 5 coins per
unit. Yellow commercial cards can lock specific resource costs to
1 coin, severing this dependency. The trading formula creates an
elegant economic arms race where building resources serves a
dual purpose — powering your own constructions and taxing your
opponent's purchases.

FREE CONSTRUCTION CHAINS: Starting in Age II, certain
buildings display a white chain symbol linking them to a previous
building. If you built the prerequisite, you construct the new card
for free, bypassing all resource costs. This rewards long-term
planning across ages and creates satisfying "combo" moments. The
chains also add draft tension: taking a card in Age I partly for its
chain value in Age II means weighing immediate benefit against
future payoff. The chain system effectively builds a lightweight
tech tree without requiring a separate board or tracker.

MILITARY TRACK AS TUG-OF-WAR: The board's central feature
is a linear track with 19 spaces, the Conflict pawn starting in the
middle. Each shield icon on military cards or Wonders pushes
the pawn one space toward the opponent's capital. The track is
divided into zones, each containing a Military token that triggers
when the pawn crosses into it — forcing the opponent to lose 2 or
5 coins. This means military pressure has both an economic and
an existential dimension. Pushing into a new zone hurts the
opponent's treasury immediately, while threatening to reach their
capital for an instant win. Crucially, the pawn can swing back —
a player behind on military can invest in red cards to reclaim lost
ground. The loser of each Age gets to choose who goes first in the
next, providing a catch-up mechanism tied to military position.

AGE ESCALATION AND DECK COMPOSITION: The three Age decks
are carefully constructed to create a natural arc. Age I is
foundation-building: cheap resource cards, basic military, simple
science. Age II introduces manufactured goods, stronger military
(Archery Range with 2 shields), and the chain-building mechanic.
Age III eliminates all brown and grey resource cards, replacing
them with high-value blue, green, and red cards plus Guilds. This
forces players to have their economic engine in place before the
final age. The 3 random Guild cards (from 7 available) shuffled
into Age III add end-game scoring variability and reward whoever
best matches the Guild's criteria. The escalation ensures the game
builds toward a dramatic conclusion rather than petering out.

PROGRESS TOKENS AS SCIENCE BONUS: Collecting a matching
pair of science symbols lets you claim one of 5 Progress tokens
(from 10 available, randomized each game). These are powerful
persistent effects: Architecture reduces Wonder costs by 2
resources, Strategy adds +1 shield to all future military cards,
Economy lets you profit from opponent trades. Progress tokens
reward the science path even when Scientific Supremacy is not
achievable, making green cards valuable for their secondary
benefit. The tokens also create pivotal decision points — which
token you select can reshape your entire strategy mid-game.

THREE-WAY CARD USE: Every accessible card can be used in
three ways — build the depicted structure, discard for coins, or
tuck under a Wonder. This ensures no card is ever truly dead. A
resource card you cannot afford can be sold for coins. A military
card you do not want can fuel a Wonder construction. The
discard-for-coins formula (2 + yellow card count) also makes
yellow commercial cards serve double duty as income amplifiers.
This triple-use design eliminates dead turns and keeps the
decision space rich even when the pyramid offers poor options.

### Scaling Mechanisms

7 Wonders Duel is exclusively a 2-player game — the entire
design is built around the head-to-head dynamic. There is no
scaling; the player count is fixed. This is the game's sharpest
design choice. By committing to exactly two players, Bauza and
Cathala eliminated the multiplayer compromises that plague the
original 7 Wonders at two (the dummy-hand variant) and could
optimize every mechanism — the military tug-of-war, the trading
cost formula, the pyramid display — for direct rivalry. The
card count (20 per Age from 23 available, with 3 removed
unseen) provides just enough hidden information to prevent
perfect calculation.

### What Makes It #24

The card pyramid. That single mechanism transforms a drafting
game into a spatial puzzle with imperfect information. Every other
system — the triple victory conditions, the military track, the
resource trading, the Wonder draft — is strong, but they exist in
other games. The overlapping card display with its mix of face-up
and face-down cards is what makes 7 Wonders Duel singular. It
forces you to weigh what you can see against what you might
reveal for your opponent. Taking the obvious best card sometimes
means uncovering something even better for the other player.
The pyramid turns every draft pick into a risk assessment.

Bauza and Cathala achieved something rare: a two-player-only
game that feels as rich and varied as games designed for larger
groups. The three victory paths ensure no two games play out the
same way — one match might end in a dramatic military push in
Age II while the next goes to a tight civilian point count after
all three Ages. The 30-minute playtime means the stakes never
feel grinding, and the Wonder draft at the start means both
players enter with a plan, even if the pyramid forces them to
abandon it. It is a masterclass in elegant two-player design.
