## Design Notes

Designer: Elizabeth Hargrave. Published by Stonemaier Games (2022).

### Theme Integration

Wingspan Asia extends the ornithological ambition of the original Wingspan into
one of the most biodiverse avian regions on Earth, spanning habitats from the
Himalayan alpine zones to the tropical mangroves of Southeast Asia. The bird
cards are not merely mechanical components -- they are portraits of real species
with accurate wingspans, diet preferences, habitat placements, and nest types.
The educational impulse is genuine: players absorb facts about the Asian
Blue Quail, the Crested Ibis, or the Red-crowned Crane through the act of
playing them, because every stat on the card corresponds to a real biological
attribute that also drives gameplay. This is theme-as-pedagogy, where the
designer leverages the inherent fascination of bird diversity to make taxonomy
feel like discovery.

The duet mode's map board takes this further by grounding the competitive
2-player experience in a geographic metaphor. Two players compete to place
tokens on a shared grid, each Duet token representing a region of avian
presence. The map transforms the abstract engine-building of base Wingspan
into something spatial and contested -- you are not just collecting birds,
you are staking claims across an ecosystem. The flock mode, meanwhile,
uses the social nature of birding itself (the field trip, the group outing)
as a design metaphor, turning a traditionally intimate 2-player game into a
party-scale 6-7 player experience with simultaneous turns.

The standalone expansion format is itself a thematic statement. By packaging
Asia as a complete game rather than a supplement, Hargrave and Stonemaier
signal that Asian birds deserve their own spotlight, not a subordinate role
in a Western-centric base game. The 90 new bird cards form a self-contained
ecosystem that can also cross-pollinate with other Wingspan sets, mirroring
how migratory species connect continents.

### Core Loop

The core engine-building loop inherits from base Wingspan but is reshaped by
the new modes:

**Standard/Solo Mode (1 player):**
1. Choose one of four actions: Play a Bird, Gain Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards
2. Place your action cube in the leftmost open space of the chosen habitat row
3. Resolve the action (with increasing power as you fill the row with birds)
4. Activate each bird in that row from right to left, triggering brown "when
   activated" powers sequentially
5. At round end, score the round's objective, discard down to limits, rotate
   first player

**Duet Mode (2 players, competitive with shared map):**
1. On your turn, perform one of the four standard actions
2. When you play a bird, place a Duet token from that bird's spot on your
   player mat onto a matching space on the shared Duet map
3. At the end of each round, score the end-of-round goal competitively:
   points go to the player who contributes the most (ties are friendly)
4. At game end, each player scores 1 point per Duet token in their own
   largest contiguous group on the Duet map
5. The player with the most total points wins

**Flock Mode (6-7 players, individual competition in groups):**
1. Split players into two groups at the same table (3+3 for 6 players,
   3+4 for 7 players); groups are fixed for the entire game
2. Each group shares its own bird tray and birdfeeder; two players are
   active simultaneously (one per group) to reduce downtime
3. Each player builds their own individual tableau using standard Wingspan
   rules, competing as individuals — not as teams
4. The player with the most points wins (standard individual scoring)

The genius of the design is that all three modes share the same fundamental
card pool and action structure. The bird powers, food costs, and habitat
placements work identically regardless of mode -- only the meta-objective
layer changes.

### Key Design Patterns

DUET AS COMPETITIVE MAP-CLAIMING: The duet mode introduces a shared map board
where two players place Duet tokens on a grid each time they play a bird. The
token must be placed on a space matching the bird's habitat and attributes
(nest type, food, wingspan). Only one player can use each space, creating
spatial competition over the most valuable map positions. End-of-round goals
are scored competitively (points to the player who contributes more, with
friendly ties), and at game end each player scores their own largest
contiguous group of tokens. The map creates a visual representation of
each player's territorial presence, turning the engine-building experience
into a spatial contest. The design lesson is that a shared board can create
meaningful interaction in an engine builder without adding take-that
mechanisms.

FLOCK MODE AS SCALING SOLUTION: Most engine builders break at high player
counts because downtime becomes unbearable. Wingspan Asia solves this by
splitting 6-7 players into two fixed groups that share bird trays and
birdfeeders, with two players (one per group) taking turns simultaneously.
Each player still competes as an individual with their own tableau and
score -- the groups are resource-sharing arrangements, not teams. This
preserves the satisfying individual arc of engine construction while
making the game viable at party scale. The key insight is that
simultaneous play across groups works specifically because Wingspan's
engine building is low-interaction -- players do not need to wait for
opponents to resolve complex board-state changes.

STANDALONE EXPANSION AS ENTRY POINT: Wingspan Asia can be purchased and played
without owning any other Wingspan product. This is a deliberate market design
decision that doubles the product's audience: existing fans buy it for the new
birds and modes, while newcomers get a complete game at a lower price point
(the duet mode box is smaller and cheaper than base Wingspan). The design
pattern is that expansions which also function as standalone products reduce
the barrier to entry for a franchise while rewarding existing customers with
backward compatibility.

SHARED MAP AS INTERACTION LAYER: The duet map board solves a problem inherent
in multiplayer solitaire engine builders -- how do you create meaningful
interaction without adding take-that mechanisms? By externalizing token
placement onto a shared physical space where each space can only be claimed
by one player, the map gives players something to compete over spatially
without ever touching each other's tableaux. The grid format makes each
player's territory legible at a glance, and the contiguous-group scoring
at game end creates natural clustering strategies.

REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY AS EDUCATIONAL DESIGN: Each bird card in Wingspan Asia
includes real scientific data -- wingspan measurements, habitat preferences,
diet types, and nest styles -- for species specifically found in Asia. The
educational value is not bolted on; it emerges from the gameplay because
players must evaluate birds by their mechanical properties (food cost, point
value, power) which happen to correspond to real biological attributes. A
player who learns that the Japanese White-eye eats invertebrates and lives
in forests has absorbed ecological knowledge through strategic evaluation.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY AS ECOSYSTEM DESIGN: All 90 bird cards in Wingspan Asia
are designed to be shuffled into the base Wingspan deck or combined with the
European and Oceania expansions. This creates a modular ecosystem where
players can customize their card pool's geographic focus, difficulty curve,
and power level. The design constraint is significant: every new bird power
must work within the existing action economy without breaking established
engine-building patterns. This forces elegance -- new birds must be
interesting within tight mechanical boundaries.

PROGRESSIVE ROW ACTIVATION AS ENGINE PAYOFF: Inherited from base Wingspan but
worth noting as a design pattern: each habitat row becomes more powerful as
birds fill it, because taking an action in a row triggers every bird in that
row from right to left. Early-game turns feel modest; late-game turns cascade
through chains of activated powers. The escalation curve is built into the
physical layout of the player mat, making engine growth visible and
satisfying without requiring complex tracking.

VARIABLE MODE ARCHITECTURE: By shipping three distinct modes (solo, duet,
flock) in a single box, Wingspan Asia serves different social contexts without
requiring separate products. The architectural insight is that all three modes
share the same card pool, action structure, and bird powers -- only the
scoring and objective layers differ. This modular approach to mode design
means the core game was stress-tested once, and each mode is a thin layer on
top rather than a ground-up redesign.

### What Makes It #91

Wingspan Asia earns its place not through mechanical novelty in the core
engine but through its expansion of what a Wingspan game can be socially. The
duet mode is one of the most elegant competitive 2-player experiences in
modern board gaming -- two players building individual engines while
contesting territory on a shared spatial map. The flock mode solves the
scaling problem that plagues every engine builder by enabling 6-7 players
through simultaneous group play. And the standalone format makes the entire Wingspan ecosystem
more accessible. It is a masterclass in expansion design: every addition
serves a clear purpose, every mode addresses a real player need, and the
bird cards themselves continue Hargrave's mission of making ornithology
genuinely compelling through play.
