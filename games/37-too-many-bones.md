## Design Notes

Designers: Josh J. Carlson and Adam Carlson. Published by Chip Theory Games (2017).

### Theme Integration

Players are Gearlocs — small, inventive fantasy creatures — embarking on a quest
to defeat a Tyrant threatening their homeland. The theme is deliberately
compact in narrative scope: this is not a sprawling epic but a focused
adventure told through a sequence of encounter days leading to a climactic boss
fight. The Gearloc identity is expressed entirely through dice. Each character's
skill tree represents their training and growth as an adventurer, and unlocking
a new die literally puts a new physical object in your hand. The tactile
premium components — neoprene mats, PVC cards, poker-style HP chips, and heavy
custom dice — reinforce the theme of craftsmanship and invention that defines
the Gearloc species. Where most fantasy adventure games use cards or tokens to
represent abilities, Too Many Bones makes every capability something you can
pick up, roll, and feel. The result is a game where character progression is
not an abstraction tracked on a sheet but a growing pile of dice in front of
you, each one a tangible reminder of choices made across the adventure.

### Core Loop

Each playthrough follows a multi-day adventure structure:

1. ENCOUNTER DAY - Draw an encounter from the day deck. Encounters are either
   combat (fought on the 4x4 battle mat) or narrative choices (paragraph-style
   decisions with consequences). Some encounters offer branching paths — fight,
   negotiate, or explore — each leading to different rewards and risks.

2. COMBAT (when triggered) - Fought on a 4x4 grid battle mat:
   a) SELECT AND ROLL - Choose which dice to roll from your available Attack,
      Defense, and Skill dice, up to your current Dexterity stat. Each die shows
      faces corresponding to the skill it represents — attack values, special
      abilities, defensive stances, or Bones (wild results for the Backup Plan).
   b) PLACE - Assign rolled dice to your character mat (activating skills and
      abilities) or to the battle mat (for positioning, attacks, and
      battlefield effects). Unneeded dice can be stored as Backup Plans for
      use on future turns.
   c) ENEMY TURN - Enemies (Baddies) act according to their AI behavior
      patterns, attacking, moving, or spawning reinforcements.
   d) Repeat until all enemies are defeated or the Gearlocs fall.

3. TRAINING - After surviving an encounter, Gearlocs earn training points.
   Spend these to unlock new dice from your personal skill tree, a branching
   network of 16 unique skill dice per Gearloc. Each unlock adds a
   new custom die to your active pool or upgrades an existing capability.

4. LOOT AND RECOVERY - Acquire loot items (additional dice or passive
   abilities), heal using HP chips, and prepare for the next day.

5. TYRANT BATTLE - After a set number of encounter days, face the Tyrant in
   a final boss fight. The Tyrant has unique mechanics, an AI behavior deck,
   and escalating difficulty phases. Victory requires the cumulative strength
   built across the entire adventure.

Defeat: If all Gearlocs are knocked out in any encounter, the adventure ends.
The Tyrant battle is an all-or-nothing climax — there is no retreat.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE-BUILDING AS PHYSICAL ENGINE-BUILDING: The central innovation of Too Many
Bones is replacing the card pool of a deckbuilder with a dice pool. In a
deckbuilder, your engine is abstract — cards cycle through a draw pile, and
your power is statistical, diluted by deck composition. In dice-building, your
engine is immediate and tangible. Every die you have earned is rolled every
combat turn. There is no draw luck within your pool — you always have access
to your full arsenal, filtered only by the randomness of each die's faces.
This means skill tree choices have guaranteed presence in every combat round,
making each unlock feel consequential rather than probabilistic. The tradeoff
is variance on each individual die, which the Backup Plan system mitigates by
letting you bank unused results for future turns.

SKILL TREES AS DIVERGENT CHARACTER ARCS: Each Gearloc's skill tree is a
branching network where early unlocks gate access to later, more powerful
abilities. This creates meaningful decision points: do you rush toward a
powerful capstone skill, or spread across multiple branches for versatility?
The branching structure means two players using the same Gearloc in different
playthroughs will develop different dice pools and play differently. This is
RPG-style character building compressed into a single session, with the tree
serving as both progression system and strategic puzzle. Prerequisites in the
tree force players to commit to a build path early, creating the kind of
planning tension usually found in video game skill systems.

GEARLOC ASYMMETRY AS ROLE DEFINITION: The four base Gearlocs (Boomer, Patches,
Picket, Tantrum) are not minor variations on a template — they represent
fundamentally different combat roles with entirely unique skill dice. Patches
functions as a healer, managing recovery and support. Boomer controls the
battlefield as a ranged utility bomber. Tantrum delivers massive damage through
reckless aggression. Picket serves as a tank, absorbing hits and protecting
allies. Each Gearloc's
skill tree reinforces its role identity, meaning cooperative play requires
genuine role coordination. A party of four damage dealers will struggle
differently than a balanced group, and the game's difficulty is calibrated
to reward complementary team composition.

THE 4x4 BATTLE MAT AS COMPRESSION ENGINE: Combat occurs on a remarkably small
4x4 grid, which forces constant tactical tension. In a larger grid, players
could maneuver freely and avoid engagement. The tight space means every
movement matters, every position is contestable, and area-of-effect abilities
become disproportionately powerful. The small grid also keeps combat fast —
there are no wasted turns crossing empty space. Enemies and Gearlocs are
always in contact, always threatening each other. This spatial compression
transforms what could be a lengthy tactical miniatures game into a tight
puzzle where positioning decisions are both critical and quick to resolve.

BACKUP PLANS AS VARIANCE MITIGATION: The Backup Plan system is an elegant
solution to dice-game frustration. When you roll dice you cannot or choose
not to use on a given turn, you can store them as Backup Plans — banked
results available on future turns without re-rolling. This transforms bad
rolls from wasted turns into invested resources. It also creates a strategic
layer: do you use a mediocre roll now, or bank it as a Backup Plan for a
turn where you need guaranteed results? The system ensures that the inherent
randomness of dice never produces a completely unproductive turn, maintaining
player agency even when luck is unfavorable.

ENCOUNTER-DAY NARRATIVE ARC: The adventure structure — a fixed number of
encounter days followed by a Tyrant battle — creates a natural dramatic arc
without requiring a branching story engine. Early days are for building your
dice pool and acquiring loot. Middle days test your growing capabilities
against harder encounters. The final Tyrant battle serves as a climax that
validates (or punishes) every skill tree and loot decision made along the
way. This structure borrows from roguelike video games: each playthrough is
a self-contained arc with permanent progression within the session but no
carryover between sessions. The encounter deck ensures variability across
playthroughs while the Tyrant selection determines the difficulty target.

TYRANT AI AS BOSS DESIGN: Each Tyrant is essentially a boss encounter with
unique mechanical identity. Tyrants have their own behavior patterns,
escalation phases, and special rules that force the party to adapt strategies
they have been refining across the adventure. This asymmetric AI design means
the final battle is not simply "fight a stronger enemy" but "solve a unique
puzzle that tests whether your dice pool is configured for this specific
challenge." Knowing which Tyrant you will face at the start of the adventure
allows experienced players to bias their skill tree choices toward the
eventual challenge, adding a layer of strategic foresight to the entire
campaign arc.

CHIP ECONOMY AS PHYSICAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: HP and other resources are
tracked with poker-style chips rather than cards or tokens. This is not
purely aesthetic — the chip system creates a satisfying physical economy
where taking damage, healing, and spending resources all involve the tangible
exchange of weighted components. The poker chip metaphor also introduces
familiar resource-management intuitions: players instinctively understand
stacking, counting, and exchanging chips in ways that flatten the learning
curve for resource management rules.

COMPONENT PHILOSOPHY AS DESIGN STATEMENT: Too Many Bones uses neoprene mats,
PVC cards, and custom resin dice where other games would use cardboard,
paper cards, and wooden cubes. This is not incidental luxury — it is a
design choice that shapes the play experience. Dice that feel substantial
make rolling them satisfying. Neoprene mats that grip the table prevent the
accidental disruption that plagues dice-heavy games. PVC cards resist the
wear that comes from repeated shuffling across many sessions. The premium
materials serve the game's core loop: when your primary interaction is
rolling and placing dice, the quality of those dice matters more than in
a game where dice are occasional randomizers.

### What Makes It #37

Too Many Bones occupies a unique position in board gaming by transplanting the
deckbuilding engine-construction arc into a dice-based system, then wrapping
it in a cooperative RPG adventure. The dice-building mechanic solves two
problems simultaneously: it eliminates the draw-luck frustration of
deckbuilders (you always roll your full pool) while creating a more tactile
and immediate sense of character growth (each new die is a physical object
you earned). The skill tree system brings RPG-style build planning into a
single-session format, creating meaningful strategic decisions that play out
across the entire adventure rather than within individual encounters. The
4x4 battle mat demonstrates that tactical depth comes from spatial
compression, not spatial sprawl. The Backup Plan system proves that dice
games can maintain player agency without eliminating randomness. And the
premium component philosophy shows that material quality is not a luxury
add-on but a design decision that can reinforce core mechanics — when your
game is about building a dice pool, making those dice satisfying to handle
is a mechanical choice, not merely a production one. The result is a game
that feels like a tabletop RPG campaign compressed into two hours, with the
strategic depth of a deckbuilder and the tactile satisfaction of a dice game.
