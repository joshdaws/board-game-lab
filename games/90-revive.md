### Theme Integration

Revive is set in a frozen post-apocalyptic world where scattered tribes
emerge from underground shelters to reclaim the surface. The ice age
that devastated civilization is receding, and players lead competing
factions in exploring the thawing landscape, constructing machines to
survive the hostile environment, populating newly habitable locations,
and recovering artifacts from the old world. The theme sits at the
intersection of civilization-building and post-apocalyptic survival,
and the game's mechanics reflect this duality: you are simultaneously
exploring unknown territory (survival) and building permanent
infrastructure (civilization).

The modular board makes the thematic promise of exploration tangible.
At the start of the game, large sections of the map are face-down tiles
representing unexplored frozen terrain. As players push outward from
their starting positions, they flip tiles to reveal new locations —
some with valuable resources, some with hibernation pods containing
survivors, some with ancient ruins hiding artifacts. The act of
exploration is not abstracted into a card draw or a die roll; it is a
physical, spatial process of turning over tiles and incorporating them
into the emerging geography. The map at the end of a game looks nothing
like the map at the start, and that transformation tells a story of
civilizational recovery that no flavor text could match.

Each tribe brings a distinct cultural identity expressed through a unique
deck of cards and asymmetric abilities. One tribe might excel at machine
construction, reflecting a technologically-oriented culture that preserved
engineering knowledge through the long freeze. Another might specialize
in population growth, representing a community-focused society that
prioritized human survival over material preservation. The asymmetry is
not just mechanical differentiation — it is worldbuilding through gameplay.
When different tribes interact on the shared map, their competing visions
of post-apocalyptic recovery create emergent narrative tension: should the
future be built on technology, community, ancient knowledge, or territorial
expansion? The game does not answer this question; it lets the players'
strategic choices write the answer.

### Core Loop

Revive plays over a variable number of rounds until the end-game trigger
(a player takes the last major artifact from the game board). Each
player's turn follows a simple structure with deep consequences: perform
up to 2 actions, OR hibernate to cycle your cards.

1. CHOOSE ACTIONS — On your turn, perform up to 2 of the following
   actions (you may perform two different actions or the same action
   twice):
   - PLAY A CARD — Take a card from your active area and tuck it into
     a vacant card slot on your player board. If placed in a top slot,
     gain the card's top effect; if placed in a lower slot, gain its
     bottom effect. Playing a card also activates any slot modules
     matching the card's color.
   - USE SWITCH TOKEN — Slide your switch token to gain one basic
     resource (gear, book, or food). Available once per hibernate cycle.
   - EXPLORE — Choose a face-down area tile on the game board, pay the
     range cost (in food) and the tile's exploration cost, flip the tile,
     recruit a citizen card, and gain points.
   - POPULATE — Place a population figure from your tribe board onto a
     location space, paying books and range cost. The first populate
     action unlocks your tribe's bottom technology.
   - BUILD — Place a small building (3 gears) or large building (5 gears)
     on a vacant sand space, paying the range cost. Buildings adjacent to
     terrain spaces advance the corresponding machine tracks.

2. GAIN BONUSES — Many locations, machines, and board slots provide
   immediate bonuses when activated. These may include: advancing on
   machine tracks, gaining energy or crates, collecting artifacts, or
   moving progress markers.

3. FREE ACTIONS — At any point during your turn, you may also trade
   crystals for basic resources, activate machines using energy, and
   open crates.

4. HIBERNATE (ALTERNATIVE TO ACTIONS) — Instead of performing actions,
   you may hibernate: return all energy to storage, move all cards from
   your resting area to your active area (and all played cards from
   slots to your resting area), reset your switch token, and advance
   your hibernation marker one space (gaining a reward). When you reach
   the 4th hibernation space, you must remove a major artifact from the
   board — if it is the last one, the end game is triggered.

### Key Design Patterns

DUAL-EFFECT CARDS AS CORE DECISION ENGINE: Every card in Revive has both
a top effect and a bottom effect, and the decision of which slot to tuck
it into determines which effect you gain. Top slots provide one set of
benefits; bottom slots provide another. Additionally, playing a card
activates any slot modules on your player board whose color matches the
card, creating cascading bonuses as your board develops. Cards that have
been played into slots move to your resting area when you hibernate,
eventually cycling back to your active area. This cycle means cards are
not permanently consumed — they rotate through active area, card slot,
resting area, and back. The strategic depth comes from evaluating each
card across both its effects and its color (for module activation)
simultaneously. A card with a weak top effect might have a strong
bottom effect, or might activate multiple modules of its color —
making slot choice a genuinely interesting decision. The card cycling
system also creates a natural tension between playing cards (using
them now for their effects) and holding them (keeping more options in
your active area). Players who play cards aggressively trigger more
effects but hibernate sooner; players who hold cards maintain
flexibility but sacrifice action efficiency. The optimal balance
depends on the game state, the tribe's asymmetric strengths, and the
specific cards available.

TERRAIN EXPLORATION AS MODULAR DISCOVERY: The face-down terrain tiles
create a map that is partially known (the fixed central starting area)
and partially unknown (the surrounding frozen territories). Exploration
is a physical act — flipping a tile and adding it to the map — that
creates both information and geography. The tile you reveal determines
what resources are available, whether hibernation pods are present, and
how the terrain connects to adjacent tiles. This means exploration is
not just "moving into fog of war" but actively constructing the game's
geography. Two plays of Revive with the same players and tribes will
produce different maps, different strategic landscapes, and different
optimal paths. The modular exploration also creates a timing tension:
exploring early gives you information and access to resources, but
exploring later lets you build infrastructure in known territory first.
Unexplored tiles adjacent to your positions are opportunities that
might contain exactly what you need — or worthless terrain that wastes
your action. The uncertainty is localized and manageable (you know THAT
a tile is there, just not WHAT it contains), which makes exploration
feel exciting rather than random.

CITIZEN PLACEMENT AS AREA INFLUENCE: Populating locations places citizen
tokens that establish your presence and influence in a region. Citizens
score points at end-game based on the majority in connected regions,
but they also serve practical purposes: citizens in a location are
required to operate machines built there, and citizen networks create
resource distribution chains. The area influence layer adds spatial
competition to what might otherwise be a solitary engine-building
exercise. Two players exploring toward the same region must decide
whether to compete for majority (committing citizens to contested
locations) or redirect their expansion elsewhere (accepting a smaller
but uncontested domain). The citizen system creates interaction without
combat — you are not attacking opponents' citizens, but outpopulating
them — which fits the post-apocalyptic rebuilding theme: these are
survivors competing for the same habitable land, not armies destroying
each other.

MACHINE BUILDING AS ENGINE CONSTRUCTION: Machines are permanent
installations placed in locations you control, and each machine provides
an ongoing mechanical benefit: resource production, action amplification,
movement capability, or scoring bonuses. Building machines requires
resources (paid from hand cards or generated by existing machines,
creating a bootstrapping dynamic), an appropriate location, and often
a citizen present to operate the machine. The engine construction
aspect of Revive lives in the machine network: each new machine makes
future turns more productive, creating the satisfying acceleration
curve that defines engine-building games. But machines are also
territorial — they exist at specific map locations, which means your
engine is spatially distributed rather than consolidated on a personal
player board. An opponent who controls the territory around your machines
can limit your expansion even without destroying the machines themselves.
This spatial engine design creates vulnerability and strategic depth
that purely tableau-based engines lack.

TRIBE ASYMMETRY THROUGH UNIQUE CARD DECKS: Each tribe has a unique
starting deck and access to tribe-specific cards in the market. This
means asymmetry is not limited to a special power or starting bonus —
it permeates every card play decision across the entire game. A tribe
with strong exploration cards will naturally push outward faster,
discovering more territory and claiming more hibernation pods. A tribe
with powerful machine-building cards will construct dense infrastructure
networks in a smaller territory. The deck-based asymmetry is elegant
because it works through the multi-use card system: tribe-specific cards
are not just different actions but different slotting options, different
resource values, and different strategic orientations. Players discover
their tribe's strengths through play rather than reading a special
power card, which creates a deeper learning curve and more satisfying
mastery arc.

SLOT-BASED PLAYER BOARD UPGRADES: The player board in Revive is not
a static reference — it is an active construction zone. Slotting cards
into designated positions on the board provides permanent passive bonuses
that modify your capabilities for the rest of the game. Each slot
position accepts cards with specific icons, meaning you cannot slot any
card anywhere — you must find cards whose icons match the slots you want
to fill. As slots fill, your board transforms from a blank canvas into
a personalized engine that reflects your strategic choices. A board
heavy with production icons generates resources efficiently; a board
focused on movement icons enables rapid exploration. The slotting system
also creates a secondary market evaluation: when drafting cards from the
shared market, you evaluate not just the card's action but its slot icon.
A card with a mediocre action but a perfect slot icon might be the most
valuable pick in the market. This dual evaluation layer adds depth to
every acquisition decision.

ANCIENT ARTIFACTS AS SET COLLECTION OBJECTIVES: Scattered across the
frozen landscape are artifacts from the pre-apocalyptic world — remnants
of the civilization that fell. Collecting artifacts from explored
locations provides set-collection scoring at end-game, with increasing
returns for larger, more diverse sets. The artifact system adds an
exploration incentive beyond territorial control: even locations that are
strategically marginal might contain a high-value artifact that completes
a scoring set. Artifacts also create turn-to-turn micro-objectives that
guide exploration direction: if you need one more artifact of a specific
type, the face-down tiles adjacent to known artifact locations become
priority exploration targets. The set collection layer gives players
who fall behind in area control an alternative scoring path, ensuring
that the game remains competitive even when territorial competition
goes poorly.

HIBERNATION PODS AS EXPLORATION REWARDS: Certain terrain tiles contain
hibernation pods — survivors from the old world preserved in cryogenic
sleep. Discovering and recovering these survivors provides immediate
bonuses (citizens, resources, cards) and represents the thematic core
of the game: finding and rescuing the remnants of lost civilization.
Mechanically, hibernation pods incentivize exploration for its own sake,
separate from territorial considerations. A player might explore into
marginal territory specifically because the tile distribution suggests
pods might be present. The pods also provide a catch-up mechanism:
players who explore aggressively are rewarded with immediate resources
that partially offset the tempo cost of exploration. The thematic
resonance — literally waking up frozen survivors and integrating them
into your growing tribe — gives exploration an emotional weight that
pure resource acquisition would lack.

### What Makes It #90

Revive synthesizes several proven Euro-game mechanisms — multi-use cards,
modular boards, engine building, area control — into a design where they
reinforce each other rather than competing for the player's attention.
The multi-use card system is the connective tissue: every decision about
exploration, construction, population, and technology flows through the
same card-play moment, creating a unified decision space where strategic
priorities must be expressed through a single action each turn. The
modular map ensures that spatial reasoning and engine building coexist
rather than occupying separate mental tracks. And the tribe asymmetry,
expressed through deck composition rather than special powers, creates
replayability that emerges from the game's core mechanism rather than
being bolted on. At 3.55 weight, Revive delivers a satisfyingly complex
civilization-building experience in under two hours — a compression that
heavier 4X games rarely achieve.
