## Design Notes

Designer: Stefan Feld. Published by alea / Ravensburger (2011).

### Theme Integration

Set in the Loire Valley during the 15th Century. Players are
influential princes developing their estates through trading,
livestock farming, city building, and scientific research. The
theme is lighter than in many top-ranked games — the medieval
estate setting provides flavor but rarely constrains mechanics.
Ships advance you on the turn order track (trade brings
influence), mines produce Silverlings (currency) at phase end,
and knowledge tiles represent scholarly advantages. Where the
theme does real work is in the estate itself: the player board
is a hex grid divided into colored regions that feel like a
landscape being cultivated — pastures for animals, rivers for
ships, cities for buildings. The spatial puzzle of filling
contiguous regions gives the abstract mechanics a satisfying
physicality.

### Core Loop

Five phases (A through E), each containing five rounds, for 25
rounds total (50 dice actions). Per round, all players roll
simultaneously, then take turns in order. Each turn:

1. TAKE TILE — Use one die to grab a hex tile from the
   matching-numbered depot on the central board; store it
2. PLACE TILE — Use one die to add a stored tile to the
   matching-numbered empty space on your estate; trigger its
   immediate effect
3. SELL GOODS — Use one die to sell all goods of the
   matching-numbered type for Silverlings and VP
4. TAKE WORKERS — Use any die to gain 2 worker tiles from
   the supply (die value is irrelevant)

Players perform exactly two actions per turn, one per die, in
any combination. A fifth option — buying one tile from the
central black depot for 2 Silverlings — is available once per
turn outside the normal two actions.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE AS FLEXIBLE CURRENCY: The central innovation. Two dice
are rolled each turn, and each die is spent on one action. The
die value determines WHICH depot you take from, WHICH estate
space you place onto, or WHICH goods type you sell. Dice do
not determine WHETHER you can act — only which specific row of
options is available. This means bad rolls constrain your
choices but never leave you actionless. The design transforms
dice from a randomness generator into a decision-shaping
resource.

WORKER TILES AS DICE MODIFIERS: Each worker tile spent adjusts
a die result by exactly +/- 1 (wrapping from 1 to 6 and vice
versa). Multiple workers can be spent on a single die. This is
the pressure valve on the dice system — hoarding workers means
you can always reach the number you need, but at the
opportunity cost of spending actions to acquire them (the
"Take worker tiles" action) and the tempo cost of not doing
something else. The entire tension of the game lives in the
gap between what you rolled and what you need, bridged by
worker expenditure.

TILE PLACEMENT ON PERSONAL BOARDS: Every player has an
identical estate (or asymmetric in the advanced variant) with
37 hex spaces divided into colored regions. Tiles must match
the space color and be placed adjacent to a previously-placed
tile. This adjacency rule means your starting castle dictates
your expansion path — early placements constrain later ones.
The spatial puzzle is deeply personal; opponents cannot block
your estate, only compete for tiles from the shared depots.

REGION COMPLETION BONUSES: When all spaces of a contiguous
color region are filled, the player scores VP based on two
factors: region size (1-36 points on a triangular scale) and
current phase (10 points in phase A, declining to 2 in phase
E). This dual scoring creates powerful time pressure —
completing regions early is worth dramatically more. A size-3
region completed in phase A scores 6 + 10 = 16 points; the
same region in phase E scores only 6 + 2 = 8 points. This
declining bonus is the game's primary pacing mechanism.

IMMEDIATE TILE EFFECTS: Each tile type triggers a distinct
effect on placement, creating chains of tactical opportunity.
Ships let you grab all goods from a depot AND advance on the
turn order track. Castles grant a free bonus action with any
die value. Buildings each have a unique power (8 types).
Animals score VP equal to their animal count, plus re-score
same-type animals already in that pasture. Knowledge tiles
provide permanent rule-bending advantages. Mines produce
Silverlings at each phase end. The variety of effects means
identical dice rolls produce wildly different outcomes
depending on board state.

KNOWLEDGE TILES AS RULE BREAKERS: The 26 yellow "knowledge"
tiles are the game's most strategic layer. They permanently
alter fundamental rules: tile #1 removes the building
uniqueness constraint per city; #8 makes workers twice as
effective (+/- 2 per tile); #9 and #10 give free die
adjustment for specific tile colors. Others add end-game
scoring conditions (4 VP per animal type, 3 VP per sold goods
type, 4 VP per building of a specific type). Knowledge tiles
let players customize their engine — a player who grabs tile
#7 (extra VP per animal tile) will chase pastures; one with
tile #6 (buy from any depot) gains unmatched flexibility.

TURN ORDER TRACK: Placing ships advances your marker on the
turn order track. The first player on the track also rolls the
white die that determines where the communal goods tile is
placed each round. Going first means first pick of depot
tiles — crucial when multiple players want the same hex. Turn
order is a contestable resource earned through ship placement,
not simply rotated. This creates a strategic reason to
prioritize blue (river) spaces even when other regions seem
more immediately valuable.

BLACK DEPOT AS SAFETY VALVE: Once per turn, any player may
spend 2 Silverlings to buy one tile from the central black
depot, regardless of dice. This sits outside the normal two
actions. It provides a way to acquire critical tiles without
using a die, smoothing out situations where neither die value
matches useful depots. The Silverling cost keeps it balanced —
Silverlings are scarce (gained from mines, goods sales, and
banks) and also worth 1 VP each at game end.

FIVE-PHASE STRUCTURE WITH TILE REFRESH: At the start of each
phase, all remaining depot tiles are swept away and replaced
with fresh draws. Goods tiles for the phase are also dealt
out. This creates natural arcs — you cannot hoard options
across phases. It also means the available tile mix changes
unpredictably, forcing adaptation. The phase structure
interacts with the declining region-completion bonus to create
a strong early-game incentive and late-game desperation.

BUILDING DIVERSITY: The eight building types each appear only
once per city (connected beige region), forcing varied
construction. Warehouse lets you sell goods without a die.
Carpenter's Workshop grabs a building from any depot. Church
takes a mine, knowledge, or castle. Market grabs a ship or
animal. Boarding House gives 4 workers. Bank gives 2
Silverlings. City Hall lets you place a stored tile
immediately. Watchtower gives 4 VP outright. Each building is
a mini-combo enabler — the City Hall into another tile
placement is essentially a free action.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 2/3/4 players: 12/18/24 depot spaces filled per phase
  (spaces labeled with player-count indicators)
- 3-player variant: castle placed in depot 6 during phases
  A/C/E; mine replaces it during B/D
- Black depot: 2 tiles (2p), 3 tiles (3p), 8 tiles (4p)
- Goods sold: 2/3/4 VP per tile at 2/3/4 players
- Bonus tiles: large bonus worth 5/6/7 VP at 2/3/4 players;
  small bonus worth 2/3/4 VP
- Worker tile compensation: 1/2/3/4 workers given to players
  based on starting position (later = more workers)

### What Makes It #15

The Castles of Burgundy is Stefan Feld's masterclass in dice
mitigation — demonstrating that dice can drive strategic depth
when players have sufficient tools to shape their outcomes.
The worker tile system means skilled players consistently
outperform less experienced ones despite identical dice luck.
The personal estate board creates a satisfying spatial puzzle
where no two games develop identically, especially with 9
different board layouts (front and back). The region-completion
timing pressure, combined with 26 distinct knowledge tiles
and 8 building types, produces enormous strategic variety
within a clean, learnable rules framework. At weight 2.97, it
occupies a rare sweet spot — deep enough for experienced
gamers to explore for hundreds of plays, accessible enough
that the core loop (roll dice, take or place tiles) is
immediately intuitive. The game rewards long-term planning
(which regions to prioritize, which knowledge tiles to pursue)
while forcing constant tactical adaptation to what the dice
and available tiles offer each round.
