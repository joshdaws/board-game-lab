### Theme Integration

ISS Vanguard is a campaign-driven cooperative game about humanity's first
interstellar expedition aboard the starship Vanguard. The game's theme is
not a veneer over abstract mechanisms --- it is the structural foundation
from which every system emerges. Players command four ship sections
(Engineering, Recon, Science, and Security), each with a distinct crew
roster, specialized dice, and unique capabilities. The ship itself is a
persistent game object that evolves across the campaign: modules are
installed, crew members gain experience or suffer injuries, and the ship's
log records decisions that alter future mission options. The designers at
Awaken Realms built the game from narrative outward, treating the mechanisms
as instruments for delivering story rather than treating story as
justification for mechanisms.

The planetary exploration system makes the theme tactile. When the crew
lands on a new world, a physical exploration book is opened to reveal
illustrated points of interest, environmental hazards, and narrative
encounters. Players do not move tokens on a generic hex grid; they navigate
illustrated alien landscapes with named features and unique discovery
opportunities. Each planet has its own atmosphere --- literally, in the
form of environmental effects that modify dice rolls --- and the discoveries
made on one planet cascade forward into the campaign, unlocking research
paths, crew abilities, and story branches. The game commits fully to the
fantasy of first contact: you are not replaying a known story but
discovering one, and the physical act of opening a new planet book and
seeing its alien terrain for the first time is a deliberate design choice
that privileges wonder over mechanical efficiency.

The crew management layer grounds the science fiction spectacle in human
drama. Each crew member is a named character with a backstory, a
specialization, and a personal arc that develops across missions. Crew
members can be injured, trained, promoted, or lost permanently. When a
beloved character is killed on a hostile planet, the loss is felt not just
mechanically (you lose their dice and abilities) but narratively (their
story ends). This investment in individual crew identities transforms
tactical decisions into emotional ones: sending an injured specialist on
a dangerous mission because their skills are needed becomes a story moment,
not just a risk calculation.

### Core Loop

The campaign spans multiple missions, each consisting of a ship management
phase and a planetary exploration phase. Between missions, players return
to the Vanguard for strategic planning.

**Ship Phase (Between Missions):**

1. MISSION BRIEFING --- Read the campaign log entry triggered by the
   previous mission's outcome. New destinations, research options, and
   narrative developments are revealed. Choose the next mission from
   available options (the campaign branches based on prior choices).

2. CREW MANAGEMENT --- Assign crew members to the four sections. Each
   section has a limited number of slots. Crew members have
   specializations (biologists, engineers, soldiers, scouts) that
   determine their dice pool. Injured crew may need to rest in medbay
   rather than deploy. New recruits may be available from the crew roster.

3. SHIP UPGRADES --- Spend resources gathered from previous missions to
   install ship modules, research new technologies, and craft equipment.
   Research unlocks permanent bonuses that carry forward through the
   campaign. Module installation is spatially constrained by the ship
   board's layout.

4. SECTION PREPARATION --- Each section leader (player) selects equipment
   cards and section-specific gear to bring on the upcoming mission. Open
   drafting allows players to choose from available equipment, prioritizing
   based on anticipated mission challenges.

**Planetary Exploration Phase:**

1. LANDING --- Open the planet book to the designated starting page. The
   illustrated spread reveals the landing zone with numbered points of
   interest, environmental conditions, and immediate threats. Place section
   tokens on the starting location.

2. EXPLORATION TURNS --- On each turn, the active section performs actions:
   a) MOVE --- Navigate to an adjacent point of interest on the planet map.
   b) EXPLORE --- Interact with a point of interest by reading its
      corresponding paragraph in the exploration book and resolving the
      encounter. Encounters may require dice checks using section-specific
      dice, narrative choices with branching outcomes, or resource
      expenditure.
   c) DICE RESOLUTION --- Roll the section's dice pool. Each die face has
      a unique symbol; successes, partial successes, and failures trigger
      different narrative branches. Equipment and crew abilities can modify
      rolls, reroll dice, or add dice to the pool.
   d) SPECIAL ACTIONS --- Use section-specific abilities (Science can
      analyze samples, Security can engage threats, Recon can scout ahead,
      Engineering can repair and build).

3. THREAT MANAGEMENT --- Environmental hazards and hostile entities apply
   pressure through a threat track or timed events. Failing to manage
   threats can result in crew injuries, equipment loss, or mission
   complications. Some threats escalate over time, creating urgency.

4. DISCOVERY AND SAMPLES --- Successful exploration yields discoveries
   (narrative rewards that unlock campaign branches), samples (physical
   resources for ship upgrades), and data (used for research between
   missions). What you find and what you choose to prioritize on each
   planet shapes the campaign's trajectory.

5. EXTRACTION --- When objectives are completed or the situation becomes
   untenable, sections extract to the Vanguard. The mission's outcome is
   recorded in the campaign log, triggering consequences for the next
   session.

### Key Design Patterns

PERSISTENT CAMPAIGN STATE AS EMOTIONAL INVESTMENT: ISS Vanguard's campaign
system tracks an extraordinary volume of persistent state: crew experience,
injuries, deaths, ship modifications, research progress, discovered
artifacts, and narrative branch points. This persistence transforms each
session from a standalone experience into a chapter in a larger story. The
design insight is that emotional investment scales with accumulated history.
A crew member who has survived five missions and been promoted twice matters
more to the player than a fresh recruit, not because of mechanical
superiority but because of shared history. The campaign log serves as the
game's memory, and that memory gives weight to every decision.

ASYMMETRIC SECTIONS AS COOPERATIVE IDENTITY: Each of the four sections ---
Engineering, Recon, Science, and Security --- has a unique dice pool, unique
equipment options, and unique abilities. This asymmetry gives each player a
distinct identity and a specialized role within the crew. Engineering excels
at building and repairing, Security at combat, Recon at scouting and
movement, Science at analysis and discovery. The design ensures that no
single section can handle every challenge, forcing genuine cooperation: a
mission that requires both combat and analysis demands that Security and
Science coordinate their actions. The asymmetry also creates replayability,
as different section assignments produce different campaign experiences.

NARRATIVE BRANCHING AS CONSEQUENCE ENGINE: The game's paragraph-based
narrative system offers choices with genuine consequences. Choosing to
investigate a mysterious signal instead of securing the landing zone may
yield a crucial discovery but leave the crew exposed to danger. These
choices ripple forward through the campaign: a discovery made on one
planet may unlock a research path that provides advantages on a later
mission. The branching is not cosmetic --- different choices lead to
genuinely different missions, encounters, and campaign outcomes. This
gives players agency over the story while preventing the feeling of
narrative inevitability that plagues linear campaign games.

DICE AS CHARACTER EXPRESSION: Rather than using generic dice with uniform
probabilities, ISS Vanguard gives each section a custom dice pool with
faces that reflect their specialization. Security dice have more combat
symbols; Science dice have more analysis symbols. Crew members further
modify the dice pool by adding specialty dice or enabling rerolls. This
means that the act of rolling dice is not just a randomizer but a
character expression: your dice tell you what your section is good at,
and the tactile experience of rolling a handful of custom dice and reading
the specialized symbols reinforces your role identity.

PHYSICAL EXPLORATION BOOKS AS DISCOVERY RITUAL: The planet books are a
bold physical design choice. Instead of generating exploration content
through card draws or random tables, each planet has a dedicated
illustrated book with hand-crafted encounters, narrative text, and artwork.
Opening a new planet book and seeing its alien landscape for the first time
is a ritualized moment of discovery that no procedural system can replicate.
The physicality of turning pages and reading paragraphs aloud creates a
shared narrative experience that pulls players out of mechanical
optimization and into imaginative engagement. The tradeoff is replayability
--- once a planet's content is known, it cannot surprise again --- but the
designers accepted this tradeoff because the quality of first-time
discovery outweighs the value of infinite repetition.

RESOURCE SCARCITY AS MISSION PRESSURE: Equipment, crew stamina, and
section-specific resources are deliberately scarce. Players cannot bring
everything they need on every mission, forcing strategic prioritization
during the ship phase. On the planet surface, resource depletion creates
mounting tension: dice spent, equipment used, and crew injured are not
replenished until extraction. This scarcity prevents the comfortable
optimization that can drain tension from cooperative games. Every mission
has a moment where resources run thin and players must decide whether to
push deeper into the unknown or extract with what they have.

MODULAR DIFFICULTY AS CAMPAIGN CALIBRATION: The game includes difficulty
modifiers that can be adjusted between missions, allowing groups to
calibrate the challenge to their skill level and risk tolerance. This is
critical for a campaign game: a difficulty spike that causes a total party
kill in a one-shot game is a minor setback, but in a campaign game it can
invalidate dozens of hours of progress. The modular difficulty ensures that
the campaign remains challenging without becoming punitive, preserving the
emotional investment that the persistent state has built.

### What Makes It #157

ISS Vanguard represents the current apex of campaign-driven cooperative
design. Where many narrative games treat their mechanisms as interruptions
between story beats, ISS Vanguard integrates its systems so thoroughly that
the mechanisms ARE the story: rolling dice to analyze an alien artifact IS
the experience of scientific discovery, not an abstraction of it. The
persistent campaign state creates a sense of history and consequence that
few board games achieve, and the physical planet books provide moments of
genuine wonder that digital games struggle to replicate. At 3.66 weight, it
demands significant investment from its players, but it repays that
investment with a narrative scope and emotional depth that justify every
hour spent at the table. The game's ranking reflects a design philosophy
that treats complexity not as an end in itself but as the cost of
delivering an experience that simpler games cannot provide.
