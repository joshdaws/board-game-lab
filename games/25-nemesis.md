## Design Notes

Designer: Adam Kwapinski. Published by Awaken Realms / Rebel (2018).

### Theme Integration

Nemesis is a sci-fi survival horror board game that wears its
influences openly — Alien, The Thing, and Event Horizon compressed
into cardboard and plastic. Players wake from hibernation on a
damaged ship infested with hostile organisms, suffering from
amnesia, unsure who to trust. The designer spent five years
iterating on a single core concept: recreating the claustrophobic,
paranoid experience of sci-fi horror classics as closely as
possible. Every mechanical system serves that fantasy. Noise
tokens represent creaking bulkheads and distant skittering —
you hear something in the vents but don't know what. The Intruder
bag is Schrodinger's monster closet — you never know if you're
pulling a Larva or the Queen until the token is drawn. Exploration
tokens on facedown room tiles mean every new doorway is a gamble:
silence, slime, fire, malfunction, or something worse.
Contamination cards are hidden even from the player holding them
— you might be infected and not know it until you scan yourself,
mirroring the body-horror paranoia of the source material. The
ship itself is a character: engines of unknown status, a
self-destruct sequence that can be triggered, escape pods that
start locked, fires that spread, hull integrity that degrades
with each malfunction marker placed. Characters cannot directly
attack each other — anti-aggression implants are the lore
justification — but you can absolutely set a room on fire with
someone in it, lock them out of escape pods, sabotage the
engines, or activate self-destruct while they sleep. The theme
isn't layered on top of mechanics. The mechanics ARE the theme.

### Core Loop

Each round has two phases:

1. PLAYER PHASE — All players draw up to 5 Action cards from
   their character-specific decks. Starting with the first player
   and proceeding clockwise, each player takes a turn of exactly
   2 Actions. Actions are paid for by discarding cards from hand
   (the number on each Action card is its cost in additional
   discards). Basic Actions include Movement, Careful Movement,
   Shoot, Melee Attack, Pick Up Heavy Object, Trade, and Craft
   Item. Character-specific Action cards provide unique abilities.
   Room tiles provide Room Actions (cost 2 discards). Item cards
   provide Item Actions. After performing 2 Actions (or fewer
   plus a pass), the turn moves to the next player. Rounds of
   turns continue until all players have passed.
2. EVENT PHASE — The Time Track advances. If Self-Destruct is
   active, its marker also advances. All Intruders in rooms with
   characters attack. Fire damages Intruders. An Event card is
   drawn: Intruders move through corridors matching the card's
   number, then the Event effect resolves (spreading fire,
   causing malfunctions, triggering hatching). Finally, an
   Intruder token is drawn from the bag for development — Larvae
   become Adults, Creepers become Breeders, Adults trigger noise
   rolls, and the Queen may appear in the Nest.

The game ends when the Time Track reaches its final red space
(hyperspace jump — all non-hibernating characters die), the
Self-Destruct marker reaches its skull space (ship explodes,
everyone aboard dies), all malfunction or fire markers are
placed (hull breach, ship destroyed), or the last conscious
character hibernates, escapes, or dies. Victory requires BOTH
completing your chosen Objective AND surviving — either by
hibernating in the Hibernatorium with the ship reaching Earth,
or by launching in an Escape Pod.

### Key Design Patterns

SEMI-COOPERATIVE HIDDEN OBJECTIVES: At setup, each player
receives one Personal Objective and one Corporate Objective.
When the first Intruder appears, every player secretly discards
one objective and keeps the other. From that point, each player
pursues a hidden goal known only to themselves. Some objectives
are benign and align with group survival — ensure the ship
reaches Earth, send a signal, discover a weakness. Others demand
betrayal: ensure a specific player's character does not survive,
redirect the ship to Mars for a corporate employer, or destroy
the Nest (which may require sabotaging the ship). The first-
encounter timing is critical: players see the threat before
choosing their path, creating a moment of moral calculation
that sets the tone for the rest of the game. Because objectives
are hidden, every player action is subject to interpretation.
Did the Mechanic just check the engines to help, or to secretly
sabotage them? Did the Pilot set coordinates for Earth — or
somewhere else? You can check the Cockpit coordinates yourself,
but the Pilot doesn't have to tell the truth about what they
saw. This information asymmetry generates organic paranoia
without requiring a formal traitor mechanism.

THE INTRUDER BAG AND EVOLUTION SYSTEM: The Intruder bag is the
game's central engine of uncertainty. It begins with a specific
mix of tokens (4 Larvae, 1 Creeper, 1 Queen, 3 Adults, 1
Blank) scaled by player count. Tokens are drawn during
Encounters (when noise tokens accumulate) and during the Event
Phase's development step. The development step is where the
design shines: a drawn Larva token is removed and replaced with
an Adult; a Creeper is removed and replaced with a Breeder; an
Adult triggers noise rolls for all players. The bag's
composition evolves over the course of the game — early
encounters tend to produce smaller creatures, but every Larva
that develops means a new Adult hunting the crew. The Queen
token, when drawn during development, places the Queen miniature
in the Nest if characters are present (triggering an immediate
encounter) or adds an Egg if no one is there. The Blank token
adds an Adult to the bag if drawn and was the last token,
ensuring the bag never empties harmlessly. This system creates
an escalating threat curve without scripted events — the aliens
grow stronger because the bag's composition shifts toward
deadlier tokens as the game progresses.

NOISE AS SPATIAL TENSION: Movement through the ship generates
noise. When a character enters an empty room (no other
characters or Intruders present), they roll a noise die. Results
of 1-4 place a Noise marker in the corridor matching that
number connected to the entered room. A result of Silence means
nothing happens (unless the character has a Slime marker, which
converts Silence to Danger). Danger means an Intruder in a
neighboring room moves toward you, or if none exist, noise
markers spread to all connected corridors. The critical rule:
if you must place a Noise marker in a corridor that already has
one, an Encounter is triggered instead — draw from the Intruder
bag. Noise tokens are physical breadcrumbs of your passage
through the ship, and they accumulate toward inevitable
confrontation. The Careful Movement action (cost 2) lets you
choose which corridor receives the noise, giving tactical
control at the cost of tempo. Moving into occupied rooms (with
characters or Intruders) generates no noise, creating a
mechanical incentive to travel in groups — which conflicts with
the hidden-objective system's incentive to act alone. This
tension between safety-in-numbers and secret-agenda-in-solitude
is one of the game's finest design achievements.

CHARACTER-SPECIFIC ACTION DECKS: Each of the six characters
(Captain, Pilot, Scientist, Scout, Soldier, Mechanic) has a
unique deck of 10 Action cards representing their expertise.
The Mechanic can repair engines and use Technical Corridors.
The Scientist can analyze alien specimens. The Soldier has
superior combat options. The Scout excels at movement and
reconnaissance. The Pilot can navigate and set coordinates. The
Captain has leadership abilities and the Log Key for accessing
crew records. These decks are not just flavor — they define
what each character CAN DO mechanically. Since Action cards are
also the currency for paying costs (every action requires
discarding cards equal to the printed cost), using a powerful
special ability means fewer cards available for basic survival
actions. Your deck is simultaneously your ability set, your
action economy, and your health bar — when it runs out, you
reshuffle your discard pile, but Contamination cards mixed in
cannot be spent, slowly strangling your options.

CONTAMINATION AND INFECTION: Melee attacks force the player to
draw a Contamination card, which enters the Action discard pile.
Contamination cards look like Action cards from the back but
cannot be spent to pay action costs. They clog your hand, reducing
your effective options each turn. Worse, each Contamination card
contains hidden text — revealed only by using the Scanner overlay
tool — that indicates whether you are INFECTED. If you never scan,
you don't know your status until the Victory Check at game end,
where infected characters die (and a Larva is placed on their
board). You can scan at certain rooms (Surgery, Canteen, Shower)
to discover and remove non-infected cards, but if you ARE
infected, a Larva is placed on your character board. Surgery can
remove the Larva but costs you your entire turn and a Light
Wound. The system creates a slow-burn dread: every melee attack
and certain Intruder attacks add Contamination cards, and you must
decide whether ignorance or knowledge is more dangerous.

ESCAPE ARCHITECTURE — PODS AND HIBERNATION: The game provides
two survival paths, each with distinct risk profiles. Escape
Pods start Locked and are distributed across two Evacuation
Sections. They can be unlocked via the Hatch Control System room
action, automatically unlock when the first character dies, and
unlock when the Self-Destruct Track reaches yellow. Each pod
holds 2 characters. Entering a pod requires a Noise roll (if an
Intruder appears, entry fails), and launching removes you from
the game permanently — you find out at end-game if you won.
Alternatively, characters can Hibernate in the Hibernatorium
once chambers open (when the Time Track reaches blue spaces).
Hibernation also requires a Noise roll, and hibernating
characters ride with the ship — so they need the engines
functional and the coordinates set correctly. Pod escape is
independent of ship fate; hibernation ties your survival to the
ship's condition. This dual-path system means players can pursue
fundamentally different exit strategies, and a betrayer can
target one path (sabotage engines to kill hibernators, lock pods
to strand evacuees) without eliminating all hope.

THE SHIP AS DEGRADING SYSTEM: The Nemesis (the ship) is not
static scenery — it is a failing machine with multiple
interlocking subsystems. Three Engines of unknown status (each
a facedown token pair, one Working and one Damaged) determine
whether the ship can jump — 2 of 3 must be functional. Players
can check, repair, or sabotage engines, and they don't have to
tell the truth about what they found. Eight Malfunction markers
represent hull integrity; if all 8 are placed, the ship is
destroyed. Eight Fire markers track conflagrations; if all 8 are
placed, the ship explodes. The Self-Destruct sequence, once
activated at the Generator, advances each round and cannot be
stopped after reaching yellow. The Destination is set via the
Cockpit and verified by the Coordinates card — but the card is
checked secretly, and players can lie about what they saw. The
ship is a web of interconnected failure states, and every system
that degrades makes all other problems worse: fire causes
malfunctions, malfunctions disable rooms needed to fight fires,
damaged engines mean hibernation is suicide, locked pods mean
escape pods are useless.

INTRUDER WEAKNESS DISCOVERY: Three random Weakness cards are
placed facedown on the Intruder board at setup, keyed to three
types of Objects (Character Corpse, Intruder Carcass, Intruder
Egg). To discover a Weakness, a character must carry the
corresponding Object to the Laboratory and perform its Room
Action. Discovered Weaknesses are flipped face-up and modify
the basic rules of the Intruders, giving all players a small
advantage. This system creates a research sub-game: someone
must risk carrying alien specimens across a hostile ship to a
specific room, spending precious actions to unlock shared
knowledge. It rewards cooperation in a game that simultaneously
incentivizes distrust — a classic semi-cooperative tension.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1 player: Solo mode with a dedicated Solo/Coop Objective deck.
  Item availability per room is halved (rounded up). Intruder
  bag starts with fewer tokens. The player must fulfill their
  Objective and survive — a pure puzzle against the system.
- 2 players: Standard semi-cooperative rules. 2 Escape Pods
  available. Intruder bag adds 1 Adult per player beyond the
  base mix. Paranoia is most intense at this count — every
  action your single companion takes is scrutinized.
- 3-4 players: 3 Escape Pods. More Intruder tokens in the bag.
  Alliances form and fracture. Pod scarcity becomes meaningful —
  4 players competing for 6 pod spaces (3 pods x 2 seats) means
  someone might get locked out.
- 5 players: 4 Escape Pods (8 seats). Maximum Intruder token
  count in the bag. More noise generated per round due to more
  characters moving. The ship feels more crowded and chaotic.
  Pod availability is adequate but unlocking them takes
  coordination.
- Fully cooperative mode: Uses Solo/Coop Objectives dealt face-
  up. ALL objectives must be fulfilled and at least 1 character
  must survive. Removes hidden-objective paranoia for groups
  that prefer pure cooperation.
- Playing as an Intruder: The first eliminated player can take
  control of the Intruders using a dedicated Intruder Action
  deck, adding a player-driven antagonist. This turns
  elimination into a role change rather than spectating.

### What Makes It #25

The noise token. That single mechanic — roll a die when you
enter an empty room, place a marker in a corridor, and if a
corridor already has a marker, draw from the Intruder bag — is
what makes Nemesis work. It transforms every movement action
into a risk calculation. It makes the ship feel alive with
unseen threats. It creates a physical map of danger that all
players can read, generating shared dread. And it ties directly
into the hidden-objective system: when you need to reach a
specific room to complete your secret goal, you know every step
generates noise that could summon something terrible — for you
and for everyone near you. The Intruder bag's evolution ensures
that what gets summoned grows worse over time. The contamination
system ensures that fighting what arrives has its own slow cost.
The ship's degrading systems ensure that even if you survive the
aliens, the vessel itself might kill you. And the hidden
objectives ensure that the person beside you — the one you've
been cooperating with to repair engines and put out fires —
might need you dead to win. Nemesis earns its place on this
list because it is the most successful marriage of narrative
horror and mechanical paranoia in modern board gaming. It
doesn't simulate a horror movie — it generates one, every time,
at the table.
