### Theme Integration

Unmatched: Cobble & Fog stages impossible duels between literary horror
icons — Dracula, Sherlock Holmes, the Invisible Man, and Jekyll & Hyde — on
the fog-shrouded streets of Victorian London. The genius of the Unmatched
system is that it treats character identity as the primary design variable.
Each fighter's deck is not a generic collection of attack and defense cards
but a bespoke mechanical portrait. Dracula's cards emphasize draining life
and recovering health through combat, modeling the vampire's parasitic
immortality. Sherlock Holmes fights alongside Watson as a team, using
deduction-themed cards that reward careful positioning and information
advantage. The Invisible Man's deck exploits his ability to avoid detection,
with movement tricks and ambush attacks that punish opponents who cannot
pin him down. Jekyll & Hyde switches between defensive fragility and
monstrous aggression, with a transformation mechanic that mirrors the
novella's central tension.

The point-to-point movement on a shared map creates the spatial context for
these character fantasies to collide. Line of sight matters — ranged attacks
require visibility, and the Victorian streetscape offers alleys and corners
that favor certain characters over others. The Invisible Man thrives in
open spaces where his evasion shines; Dracula prefers tight corridors where
escape is difficult for his prey. The map is not merely a backdrop but an
active participant in the asymmetric matchup, creating positional puzzles
that differ depending on which characters are fighting.

The literary source material does real design work here. Because each
character comes from a well-known novel, players arrive with intuitive
expectations about how the character should play. The design team leverages
these expectations — Dracula feels predatory, Holmes feels cerebral, the
Invisible Man feels slippery, Jekyll & Hyde feels volatile. When mechanical
execution aligns with narrative expectation, the learning curve flattens
dramatically. Players understand their character's strategy not by studying
card synergies but by inhabiting the character's fiction. This is theme
integration at its most functional: the fiction teaches the mechanics.

### Core Loop

The game is played in alternating turns until one hero's health is reduced
to zero (player elimination). Each turn consists of two actions chosen from
a simple menu.

**On Your Turn (choose 2 actions, may repeat):**

1. MANEUVER — Draw a card from your deck, then move your fighter up to
   their movement value along connected points on the map.
   a) Your sidekick (if any) may also move up to their movement value
   b) Movement is point-to-point along connected nodes
   c) Drawing a card is mandatory — this is your primary card income

2. SCHEME — Play a Scheme card from your hand for its effect. Scheme cards
   provide non-combat abilities unique to your character:
   a) Dracula's schemes involve life drain and repositioning
   b) Holmes's schemes set up deductive advantages and Watson positioning
   c) Invisible Man's schemes enhance evasion and surprise
   d) Jekyll & Hyde's schemes trigger transformation between states

3. ATTACK — Declare an attack against an adjacent fighter (melee) or a
   fighter in line of sight (ranged, if your character has ranged ability).
   a) Attacker plays a card face-down from hand (attack value + any effect)
   b) Defender may play a card face-down (defense value + any effect)
   c) Both cards revealed simultaneously
   d) If attack value exceeds defense value, defender takes damage equal
      to the difference
   e) If defender plays no card, they take full attack damage
   f) Card effects resolve — many cards have "during combat" or "after
      combat" triggers that create tactical wrinkles
   g) Boost effects: some cards allow drawing additional cards and adding
      their boost value to combat, introducing controlled randomness

**Sidekick Rules:**
- Some characters have sidekicks (Watson for Holmes, the sisters for Dracula)
- Sidekicks are separate units on the map with their own health pools
- Sidekicks can be targeted and attacked independently
- Defeating a sidekick does not eliminate the player, but removes a
  tactical asset

**Game End:** When any hero (not sidekick) is reduced to zero health,
their controller is eliminated. In a 1v1, the surviving player wins. In
team or free-for-all formats, last player standing wins.

### Key Design Patterns

CARD PLAY AS CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Unmatched's combat system replaces dice
with simultaneous card play, giving both attacker and defender meaningful
agency. The attacker chooses which card to commit (balancing power against
preserving strong cards for later); the defender chooses whether to defend
at all (saving a card means taking damage but conserving hand resources).
This dual-decision structure makes every combat a micro-negotiation between
risk and resource conservation. The design principle is that combat becomes
interesting not through complex resolution mechanics but through the
hand management decisions surrounding it. Each card spent in combat is a
card unavailable for future turns, making combat inherently costly for
both participants.

ASYMMETRY THROUGH DECK COMPOSITION: Rather than layering asymmetry through
special rules or unique boards, Unmatched locates all character identity
in the 30-card deck. Each character's deck contains the same card types
(attacks, defenses, versatile cards, schemes) but in radically different
proportions and with unique effects. This approach is elegant because it
requires learning only one rule system — the asymmetry emerges from play
rather than from rules exceptions. A new player can learn the full rule
set in five minutes and then discover their character's personality through
the cards they draw. The design insight is that asymmetry is most
accessible when it lives in content (card text) rather than in structure
(special rules).

HAND MANAGEMENT AS RESOURCE ECONOMY: Cards serve triple duty as attack
weapons, defensive shields, and scheme abilities. Your hand is your health,
your offense, and your utility simultaneously. Drawing cards requires
spending an action on Maneuver, creating tension between card acquisition
and other tactical priorities. This multi-use resource system means that
every card play involves an opportunity cost — using a strong card for
attack means it is unavailable for defense on the opponent's turn. The
hand size limit (typically 7) prevents hoarding, forcing players to
commit resources rather than stockpiling options.

LINE OF SIGHT AS SPATIAL STRATEGY: The line-of-sight mechanic transforms
the point-to-point map from a simple movement grid into a tactical
landscape. Characters with ranged attacks (Holmes) can project threat
across open areas, while melee characters (Hyde) must close distance
before engaging. Corners, obstacles, and map geometry create natural
chokepoints and ambush positions. This spatial layer ensures that
positioning matters as much as card play — a perfect attack card is
useless if you cannot reach your target, and a character caught in the
open against a ranged attacker faces a severe disadvantage.

PLAYER ELIMINATION AS NARRATIVE CLOSURE: In a genre (tactical skirmish
games) that often avoids player elimination, Unmatched embraces it as
a feature. The short game length (20-40 minutes) makes elimination
acceptable — a defeated player waits minutes, not hours. Elimination
also serves the theme: these are duels to the death between literary
icons, and the narrative demands a decisive outcome. The design lesson
is that player elimination is not inherently problematic; it becomes
problematic only when the eliminated player faces an unacceptably long
wait. By keeping games short, Unmatched makes elimination feel like a
dramatic conclusion rather than a punishment.

BOOST MECHANISM AS CONTROLLED VARIANCE: The boost system — drawing a
card from your deck and adding its boost value to combat — introduces
just enough uncertainty to prevent perfect calculation. You can analyze
your hand perfectly, but the boost draw is unknown. This controlled
variance prevents the game from becoming a solvable puzzle while keeping
randomness bounded: boost values are printed on every card in the deck,
so experienced players can calculate probabilities based on what has
been played. The variance is knowable in aggregate but unpredictable in
the moment, hitting the sweet spot between determinism and chaos.

### What Makes It #192

Unmatched: Cobble & Fog earns its ranking by demonstrating that mechanical
elegance and thematic richness are not opposing forces. The rule set fits
on a single page, yet every matchup between the four characters produces
a tactically distinct experience. Holmes versus Dracula plays nothing like
Invisible Man versus Jekyll & Hyde. The system's modularity — any Unmatched
set can cross-play with any other — creates an expanding competitive
ecosystem, but Cobble & Fog stands alone as the set with the strongest
character differentiation and the most evocative theme. At sub-2.0 weight,
it is among the lightest games at this rank, proving that low complexity
and high strategic depth are compatible when the underlying system is
sufficiently elegant. The design team at Restoration Games demonstrates
that the skirmish genre does not need miniatures, terrain rules, or
hundred-page rulebooks to deliver meaningful tactical decisions.
