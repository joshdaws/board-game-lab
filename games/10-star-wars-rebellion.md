## Design Notes

Designer: Corey Konieczka. Published by Fantasy Flight Games (2016).

### Theme Integration

Star Wars: Rebellion is the original trilogy compressed into a single board
game — and the asymmetry IS the theme. The Galactic Empire is a military
juggernaut with Star Destroyers, AT-ATs, TIE Fighters, and the Death Star
itself. The Rebel Alliance is a scrappy guerrilla force that can't win a
stand-up fight. The Empire wins by finding and conquering the hidden Rebel
base. The Rebels win by running out the clock — gaining enough reputation
through completed objectives that the galaxy rises up in revolt. This
perfectly mirrors the films: the Empire hunts, the Rebels hide and inspire.
The 25 leaders are iconic characters — Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Princess
Leia, Emperor Palpatine, Han Solo, Boba Fett — each with unique skill icons
that determine what missions they can attempt. The probe droid system (cards
showing where the base ISN'T) recreates the Empire's intelligence-gathering
from The Empire Strikes Back. Loyalty and subjugation markers model planetary
allegiance. The Death Star can destroy entire systems. Even the build queue
(units take 1-2 rounds to deploy) models industrial production timelines.
The game doesn't reference Star Wars — it IS Star Wars.

### Core Loop

Each game round has three phases:

1. ASSIGNMENT PHASE - Starting with the Rebel player, each player assigns
   leaders from their leader pool to mission cards (placed facedown). Leaders
   on missions are committed — they can't be used for movement or opposition
   this round. Unassigned leaders stay in the pool for the Command Phase.
2. COMMAND PHASE - Players alternate turns. On each turn, a player does one
   of two things: (a) ACTIVATE A SYSTEM — take a leader from the pool, place
   it in any system, move ships from adjacent systems into it (carrying ground
   units via transport capacity), resolve combat if opposing units present; or
   (b) REVEAL A MISSION — flip a facedown mission card, place the assigned
   leader in the target system, attempt or resolve the mission (opponent may
   send a leader to oppose). Players may also pass. Continue until both pass.
3. REFRESH PHASE - Retrieve all leaders to pools. Draw 2 mission cards (discard
   to 10). Imperial draws 2 probe cards. Rebel draws 1 objective card. Advance
   time marker. On recruit icons: draw 2 action cards, recruit 1 leader shown.
   On build icons: place units in build queue from loyal/subjugated systems,
   slide existing queue units one space closer to deployment. Deploy completed
   units (max 2 per system) to loyal/subjugated systems.

Win conditions: Imperial wins IMMEDIATELY by having Imperial units in the
Rebel base's system with no Rebel units present. Rebel wins when the
reputation marker and time marker occupy the same space (reputation starts
at 14, time starts at 1 — they converge as the Rebel gains reputation and
time advances). The Rebel can also play objectives during combat and the
Refresh Phase to gain reputation.

### Key Design Patterns

ASYMMETRIC VICTORY CONDITIONS AS DESIGN FOUNDATION: The entire game is built
on fundamentally different win conditions. The Empire wins by FINDING and
CONQUERING — a spatial military objective requiring intelligence gathering
and overwhelming force. The Rebels win by SURVIVING and INSPIRING — a temporal
objective requiring evasion and completing narrative objectives. The time
track starts at 1 and advances each round; the reputation marker starts at
14 and moves down as the Rebel completes objectives. When they meet, the
Rebellion succeeds. This means every round that passes without the Empire
finding the base brings the Rebels closer to victory. The Empire is always
on the clock. The Rebels can win without fighting a single battle — they
just need to stay hidden long enough. This asymmetry makes both sides feel
completely different to play: the Empire plays an aggressive deduction game,
the Rebels play a desperate survival game.

THE HIDDEN BASE MECHANISM: At setup, the Rebel player secretly selects a
probe card and places it facedown under the "Location" space. The Rebel base
exists on the board as a separate space — units can be deployed there, moved
to and from adjacent systems — but its actual location is hidden. The Imperial
player draws 2 probe cards each round, each showing a system where the base
IS NOT. By process of elimination across 32 systems, the Empire narrows
down the possibilities. When Imperial ground units enter a system, the Rebel
player MUST declare if the base is there. If found, all units from the
"Rebel Base" space are placed in the system and combat begins. The Rebel
can also RELOCATE the base via the "Rapid Mobilization" mission — drawing
4 probe cards and choosing a new location (not one with Imperial units).
This creates extraordinary tension: the Rebel player watches the Empire
search, knowing each probe card reduces hiding spots, while the Empire
player tries to read the Rebel's behavior for clues — did they just move
forces toward a specific system? Why are they defending that region? The
hidden base transforms a war game into a deduction thriller.

LEADERS AS MULTI-PURPOSE RESOURCES: The 25 leaders (12 Imperial, 13 Rebel)
are the game's scarcest resource. Each leader has: skill icons (Diplomacy,
Intel, Spec Ops, Logistics) that determine mission eligibility, tactic values
(space and ground) that determine combat card draws, and combat bonuses. In
the Assignment Phase, you commit leaders to missions — but every leader on a
mission is unavailable for movement and opposition during the Command Phase.
This creates a constant tension: send Luke on a Spec Ops mission (sabotaging
an Imperial system), or keep him in the pool to activate a system and lead a
fleet? Use Vader to hunt Rebel operatives, or save him to lead a Star
Destroyer armada? Leaders assigned to missions also telegraph intention —
your opponent sees HOW MANY leaders you assigned (though not to which
missions), giving them information about your plans. Starting with 4 leaders
each and recruiting more over time, the leader pool grows but never
eliminates the opportunity cost.

MISSION SYSTEM WITH OPPOSITION: Missions represent the narrative events of
Star Wars — stealing Death Star plans, turning Luke to the dark side,
sabotaging Imperial shipyards, rallying systems to the Rebellion. Each
mission card requires specific skill icons (e.g., 1 Intel icon) and has
an "attempt" or "resolve" effect. "Resolve" missions auto-succeed — the
card's effect happens. "Attempt" missions can be OPPOSED: after the active
player declares the target system, the opponent may send a leader from their
pool to that system. If opposed, both players roll dice equal to their
combined skill icons matching the mission type. Hits vs. direct hits
determine success. The opposition mechanic creates a bluffing game within
the mission system: the Rebel player assigns Leia to a mission — is it a
critical intel mission or a decoy? The Imperial player must decide whether
to commit a leader to oppose, knowing that leader then can't activate
systems. Starting missions (marked with a curved arrow) return to hand
after use, providing reliable repeated actions.

PROBE CARD DEDUCTION: The Imperial player has 31 probe cards (one per
system except Coruscant, which is always Imperial). At setup, cards
matching systems with Imperial units are removed. Each Refresh Phase, the
Imperial draws 2 more probes. Each probe card shows a system where the
Rebel base is NOT located. Over the course of the game, the Empire
systematically eliminates possibilities. But the Rebel can relocate the
base (moving to a system the Empire has already "cleared" via probes).
The probe system creates a meta-game of deduction: the Empire knows with
certainty where the base ISN'T, and must combine that knowledge with
behavioral reads and strategic reasoning to guess where it IS. Intel
missions let the Empire draw additional probes, accelerating the search.
The Rebel's knowledge of which probes the Empire holds (they're secret)
is imperfect — creating genuine uncertainty on both sides.

LOYALTY AND SUBJUGATION: Each populous system has a loyalty space that can
hold a Rebel loyalty marker, Imperial loyalty marker, or nothing (neutral).
Diplomacy missions are the primary way to gain loyalty. Loyal systems
produce units for their faction during build phases. The Empire has a unique
alternative: SUBJUGATION. When Imperial ground units occupy a system without
Imperial loyalty, a subjugation marker is placed on top of any existing
loyalty marker. Subjugated systems produce for the Empire (using only the
leftmost resource icon) and cannot produce for the Rebels — but the
subjugation is fragile (removed if all Imperial ground units leave). This
asymmetry means the Empire can forcibly extract resources from conquered
worlds while the Rebels must earn loyalty through diplomacy. It also
creates strategic depth: the Empire might subjugate a Rebel-loyal system
to deny its resources rather than to gain them.

COMBAT WITH DUAL THEATERS: Combat resolves in rounds, each with two
simultaneous theaters: Space Battle and Ground Battle. Each round: (1) add
a leader from pool if needed (for tactic values), (2) draw tactic cards
equal to your leader's space/ground tactic values, (3) resolve combat round
— space battle first (both players attack with all ships), then ground
battle (both attack with all ground units), then retreat option. Attacks
roll dice matching unit attack values (black dice: 1 hit, 1 direct hit per
die; red dice: 1 hit, 1 direct hit per die but with different distributions).
Hits must be assigned to units matching the die color's health; direct hits
can target any unit. Tactic cards add special abilities — block damage,
deal extra damage, trigger narrative effects. The dual-theater system means
space superiority doesn't automatically translate to ground victory — you
can control the skies but still lose the planet. Transport capacity matters
because ground units need ships to travel, creating logistical challenges.

THE DEATH STAR: A unique Imperial unit that can DESTROY ENTIRE SYSTEMS.
Requires the "Superlaser Online" project card (drawn via the "Research and
Development" mission from the project deck). Once operational, the Death
Star can obliterate a system — placing a destroyed system marker, eliminating
all Rebel ground units there. If the Death Star destroys the system
containing the Rebel base, the Empire immediately wins. The Death Star is
nearly invincible in combat early game but can be destroyed by the "Death
Star Plans" objective card. The Death Star creates a narrative arc that
mirrors the films: the Empire builds this ultimate weapon, the Rebels must
either destroy it or ensure it never finds their base. Its mere existence
on the board changes the Rebel player's calculations about base location
and military engagement.

BUILD QUEUE AS PRODUCTION TIMING: Units are not instantly deployed — they
enter a build queue on the faction sheet, placed in numbered spaces (1 or 2)
indicating how many rounds until deployment. Each Refresh Phase, units slide
one space toward deployment. Units that slide off the board are deployed to
loyal or subjugated systems (max 2 per system). This creates production
planning: you see what your opponent is building 1-2 rounds before it
arrives. The Imperial player has massive production capacity (more loyal/
subjugated systems) but must still wait for units to deploy. The Rebel
player has fewer resources but can deploy to the hidden Rebel Base space,
concentrating forces in secret. The queue system prevents instant
reinforcement and rewards strategic foresight.

OBJECTIVE CARDS AS REBEL VICTORY ENGINE: The Rebel player draws from a
structured objective deck (Tier I on top, then II, then III — ensuring
early objectives are achievable and late ones are dramatic). Each objective
has a condition (e.g., "Play after at least 1 Imperial ground unit has been
destroyed in a system that contains a Rebel unit") and a reputation value.
When fulfilled, the Rebel plays the card, gains reputation (moving the marker
toward the time marker), and gets closer to winning. Only one objective can
be played per combat and per Refresh Phase. The tiered structure creates a
natural narrative arc — early objectives are small victories (intelligence
wins, minor skirmishes), late objectives are decisive moments (destroying
the Death Star, liberating key systems). The Rebel player must balance
pursuing objectives against protecting the base.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 2 players: Standard game. One controls all Empire, one all Rebels. The
  full experience as designed.
- 3 players: Rebels have 1 player; Empire splits into Admiral (blue leaders:
  space battles, building/deploying units, recruiting) and General (orange
  leaders: ground battles, mission cards, probes, ground combat). Open
  communication on same team but must discuss in front of opponents.
- 4 players: Both factions split into Admiral and General. Each controls half
  the leaders. Initiative numbers on faction sheets determine turn order
  during Command Phase.
- Advanced setup: After first game, players use variable starting positions
  — probe cards determine initial loyalty distribution, and players choose
  where to place starting units.

### What Makes It #10

The hidden base. One secret choice at the start of the game — where to put
the Rebel base — transforms every subsequent decision for both players. The
Empire has overwhelming military force but doesn't know where to point it.
The Rebels have inferior forces but the advantage of secrecy. Every Imperial
probe card drawn is a tightening noose. Every Rebel mission is both a
strategic action and a potential clue about base location. The leader
assignment system forces brutal opportunity costs — every hero sent on a
mission is a hero not leading a fleet. The combat is satisfying (dual
theaters, tactic cards, the Death Star) but it's secondary to the deduction
game. Star Wars: Rebellion is the best asymmetric 2-player experience on
this list because the two sides don't just have different units — they have
fundamentally different games they're playing, connected by the same board
and the same ticking clock.
