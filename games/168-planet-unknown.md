### Theme Integration

Planet Unknown imagines a future where humanity has exhausted Earth's resources
and must colonize alien worlds to survive. Each player represents a
corporation terraforming a newly discovered planet, laying infrastructure
across its surface to make it habitable. The theme elegantly justifies the
game's core spatial puzzle: polyomino tiles represent modular terraforming
units --- water reclamation systems, biomass cultivators, rover pathways,
civic structures, and technological installations --- that must be fitted
onto the planet's grid. The planet is literally being built, tile by tile,
and the physical act of covering the grid mirrors the narrative of
transforming an alien landscape into a functioning colony.

The shared space station at the table's center --- a rotating lazy Susan
holding tile supply rings --- is the game's most distinctive thematic and
mechanical element. All corporations draw from the same orbital station,
which rotates after each selection, changing which tiles are available to
each player. This models the logistical reality of a shared supply chain:
terraforming equipment arrives from orbit, and corporations compete for the
most useful modules as the station's inventory rotates. The physical rotation
creates a tangible sense of scarcity and competition that abstract selection
mechanisms cannot match. Players watch the station turn and calculate which
tiles will reach them, creating anticipation and rivalry through a simple
physical device.

Each planet board has a unique terrain layout with different obstacle patterns
and scoring opportunities, reflecting the diversity of alien worlds. Some
planets are heavily cratered, requiring creative tile placement around
obstacles. Others offer bonus regions that reward specific tile types. The
variable planet boards, combined with asymmetric corporation powers, ensure
that each player faces a distinct puzzle shaped by their world's geography
and their corporation's capabilities. The theme of planetary colonization
makes this asymmetry feel natural: of course different planets present
different challenges, and of course different corporations bring different
technological specializations.

### Core Loop

Planet Unknown is played over a series of simultaneous turns until no player
can place a tile. Each turn follows a streamlined sequence:

1. STATION ROTATION --- The active player (or all players simultaneously in
   the standard mode) selects a tile from the space station's supply rings.
   The station is a physical lazy Susan divided into sectors, one per player.
   Each sector contains two rings of tiles. The active player chooses one
   tile from either ring in their sector.

2. TILE PLACEMENT --- Each player simultaneously places their selected tile
   onto their personal planet board. Tiles are polyomino shapes (dominoes
   through pentominoes) composed of two terrain types. They may be rotated
   and flipped but must fit within the grid and cannot overlap existing tiles
   or certain terrain obstacles. Each tile covers grid squares, and coverage
   is the primary objective: uncovered squares represent unterraformed
   territory.

3. TRACK ADVANCEMENT --- Each tile's terrain types correspond to tracks on
   the player's corporation board. When a tile is placed, the player advances
   the tracks matching the tile's terrain types by one step each. The six
   tracks are:
   a) WATER --- Advances the water reclamation track. Higher levels unlock
      synergy bonuses and lifepod rescue capabilities.
   b) BIOMASS --- Grows organic resources. Biomass tiles placed adjacent to
      other biomass tiles score increasing pattern bonuses.
   c) ROVER --- Deploys a rover onto the planet grid. The rover moves across
      placed tiles, collecting resources and activating bonuses on the
      spaces it visits.
   d) CIVIC --- Builds population centers. Civic structures score based on
      the largest connected group of civic tiles.
   e) TECHNOLOGY --- Advances the tech track, unlocking permanent abilities
      that modify placement rules or scoring conditions.
   f) ENERGY --- Provides immediate one-time bonuses or end-game scoring
      multipliers.

4. ROVER MOVEMENT --- If the rover track was advanced, the player moves their
   rover figure on the planet grid. The rover can collect lifepods (rescued
   colonists worth points), meteorites (resources), and activate tile
   bonuses. Rover pathing across the planet creates a secondary spatial
   puzzle layered over the tile placement puzzle.

5. END CONDITION CHECK --- If any player cannot legally place a tile (no
   valid placement exists on their board), the game ends for all players
   after the current round. Players score across all six tracks, add bonuses
   for rescued lifepods and objective cards, subtract penalties for
   uncovered terrain, and compare totals.

### Key Design Patterns

LAZY SUSAN AS RONDEL INNOVATION: The physical rotating space station is
Planet Unknown's signature contribution to board game design. It functions
as a three-dimensional rondel --- a circular selection mechanism --- but
the physicality of rotation adds dimensions that an abstract rondel lacks.
Players can see the entire station, anticipate which tiles will rotate to
their sector, and plan accordingly. The rotation creates a drafting
dynamic without the overhead of passing cards: you do not choose what to
pass, but the station's rotation determines what reaches each player. The
lazy Susan also creates a social focal point --- all eyes turn to the
station as it rotates, building anticipation and shared excitement. Lambert
and Rehberg proved that a physical mechanism can be a game's most memorable
design element, generating emergent gameplay through the simple act of
turning a disc.

DUAL-TERRAIN TILES AS MULTI-TRACK ADVANCEMENT: Each polyomino tile is
composed of exactly two terrain types. Placing a tile advances two of six
tracks simultaneously, forcing players to consider track combinations with
every placement. This dual-terrain design creates constant tension: you
may want to advance your technology track, but the available tile pairs
technology with a terrain type you do not need. The pairing constraint
prevents players from specializing exclusively in one track, ensuring
broad development. It also makes tile selection richer than pure spatial
evaluation --- the same tile might be spatially perfect but strategically
suboptimal if it advances the wrong tracks, or spatially awkward but
strategically essential for its track combination.

SIMULTANEOUS PLAY AS ACCESSIBILITY BRIDGE: By having all players select
and place tiles simultaneously, Planet Unknown eliminates downtime and
scales gracefully from one to six players. A six-player game takes roughly
the same time as a two-player game. This design choice is strategically
significant beyond mere convenience: it positions a game with fourteen
listed mechanics and six interlocking tracks at a weight of just 2.25.
Simultaneous play compresses decision time because players cannot analyze
opponents' boards in detail between their own turns, encouraging intuitive
play over exhaustive calculation. The result is a game that feels lighter
than its mechanical complexity suggests, making it accessible to players
who would be intimidated by the same systems in a sequential-turn format.

ROVER AS SECONDARY SPATIAL LAYER: The rover mechanism adds a movement
puzzle on top of the tile placement puzzle. After placing tiles, players
move a figure across their completed terrain, collecting resources and
activating bonuses. The rover creates planning considerations that extend
beyond the current tile: players must think about where the rover needs to
travel and ensure that placed tiles create viable paths to valuable targets.
This layering of a movement game on top of a placement game gives Planet
Unknown a strategic depth that exceeds most polyomino games, where placement
is the only spatial concern.

ASYMMETRIC CORPORATIONS AND PLANETS: Each player can combine any corporation
(providing unique powers and track modifications) with any planet board
(providing unique grid layouts and scoring bonuses). This combinatorial
asymmetry means the number of possible player configurations is the product
of corporations times planets, creating enormous replay variety from a
modest number of components. The asymmetry also allows players of different
skill levels to self-balance: experienced players can choose harder planet
configurations while newcomers select more forgiving ones.

PATTERN SCORING AS ORGANIC INCENTIVE: Biomass tiles score based on
orthogonal adjacency --- the larger the connected group of biomass tiles,
the higher the score. This pattern-scoring incentive creates a secondary
spatial objective that may conflict with optimal grid coverage. Players
must decide whether to cluster biomass tiles for adjacency bonuses or
spread them to fill gaps efficiently. The pattern scoring adds a layer
of spatial strategy that extends beyond simple coverage and rewards players
who can simultaneously optimize multiple spatial objectives.

LIFEPOD RESCUE AS NARRATIVE THREAD: Scattered across the planet grid are
lifepod tokens representing stranded colonists. Rescuing them requires
advancing the water track and moving the rover to their locations. The
lifepod mechanism adds a narrative thread --- you are not just terraforming,
you are saving lives --- that gives emotional weight to the spatial puzzle.
It also creates racing dynamics between players who share the same lifepod
arrangement, as rescued pods are scored individually and create urgency
to reach them before the game ends.

### What Makes It #168

Planet Unknown succeeds because it makes complexity invisible. Fourteen
mechanics and six interlocking tracks would normally produce a rules-heavy
experience, but simultaneous play, intuitive tile placement, and the
brilliant lazy Susan mechanism compress the cognitive load into something
that feels like solving a satisfying puzzle rather than managing a
spreadsheet. Lambert and Rehberg achieved what few designers manage: a game
that offers meaningful strategic decisions to experienced players while
remaining genuinely accessible to newcomers. The physical space station
creates a table presence and social dynamic that digital implementations
cannot replicate, anchoring the experience in the physical world. At its
core, Planet Unknown is proof that innovative physical design --- not just
mechanical design --- can elevate a game from competent to memorable.
