## Design Notes

Designer: Evan Derrick & A. J. Porfirio. Published by Van Ryder Games (2021).

### Theme Integration

Final Girl is one of the rare modern board games that commits fully to genre
simulation as its core design thesis. The game does not borrow horror movie
aesthetics as decoration — it reverse-engineers the narrative structure of
slasher films and rebuilds it as a solo decision space. The "final girl"
trope, originating in Carol Clover's analysis of horror cinema, describes
the last surviving character who confronts the killer. Derrick and Porfirio
recognized that this trope is inherently a solo experience: one protagonist,
alone, against overwhelming odds. The design commitment to solo-only play
is not a limitation but a thematic necessity. Adding cooperative or
competitive modes would break the fundamental premise.

The game's emotional arc mirrors a horror film's three-act structure with
remarkable fidelity. The early game feels like the first act: victims are
scattered across the location, the killer prowls but has not yet reached
full power, and you spend time preparing — gathering items, positioning
yourself, saving victims. The midgame escalates as victims die, the terror
track rises, and the killer's behavior becomes more aggressive. The endgame
narrows to the final confrontation: just you and the killer, resources
depleted, dice rolls carrying life-or-death stakes. This is not scripted;
it emerges from the mechanical systems. The Horror track, victim pool, and
killer AI conspire to produce the same narrative shape every time, while
the specific details vary. It is procedural horror storytelling.

The Feature Film box system — where each release pairs a killer with a
location — extends the cinematic metaphor. You are not playing a single
game; you are selecting which horror movie to watch tonight. Mixing Hans
the Butcher with the Camp Happy Trails location recreates Friday
the 13th. Pairing the alien entity with the space station evokes Alien.
Each killer has unique AI behaviors, special powers, and a dedicated terror
card deck, while each location has its own map, item deck, event deck, and
victims. The interchangeability of killers and locations means the system
generates combinatorial variety the way a film studio might remix subgenres:
slasher meets haunted house, creature feature meets suburbia.

### Core Loop

Each turn follows a structured sequence of five phases that maps to the
rhythm of a horror movie scene:

**1. ACTION PHASE (Your Turn)**

You have a pool of Time (starting at 6, reset to 6 each Planning phase,
or 5 in Extreme Horror Mode). Spend Time on:

1. MOVE — Play a movement Action card (like Walk or Sprint) and make a
   Horror Roll to move between adjacent spaces on the map. You may take
   up to 2 victims with you when leaving a space. Movement is constrained
   by the map's layout, creating chokepoints and dead ends that replicate
   horror geography.
2. SEARCH — Play a Search Action card while on a Search space and make a
   Horror Roll to draw from the location's item deck. Items provide
   weapons, healing, and special abilities. Searching costs Time and
   position.
3. SAVE A VICTIM — If you are on an Exit space with victims, you may
   save them (place them on your Final Girl card for rewards such as
   reducing Horror or gaining items). Saving enough victims unlocks your
   Final Girl's Ultimate Ability.
4. ATTACK — Play an attack Action card and make a Horror Roll (rolling
   dice equal to the current Horror Level). Each success (5 or 6) deals
   1 damage; partial successes (3 or 4) can be converted by discarding
   2 Action cards each. Weapons modify damage output. Combat costs Time
   and cards, creating a push-your-luck tension between attacking now
   versus preparing for a stronger later assault.
5. PLAY CARDS — Use action cards from your hand for special effects:
   setting traps, healing, repositioning, gaining bonus dice.

**2. PLANNING PHASE**

1. Spend remaining Time to purchase Action cards from the Action Tableau.
2. Reset Time marker to 6 (any unspent Time is lost).
3. Return all played/discarded Action cards to the Action Tableau.

**3. KILLER PHASE (AI Turn)**

1. Resolve the Killer Action on the Finale card (or its back, once
   revealed).
2. Draw and resolve the top Terror card from the Terror deck. These cards
   move the killer, trigger special abilities, kill victims, raise the
   Horror Level, or spawn new threats. Each killer's Terror deck has
   unique cards reflecting their personality and methods.

**4. PANIC PHASE**

If at least one victim was killed this turn, all victims in the killer's
space panic — roll a die for each to scatter them to adjacent spaces.

**5. UPKEEP PHASE**

1. If no Terror cards remain, reveal the Finale card.
2. Resolve any required upkeep from Events, Items, or special rules.
3. Rearrange items between hands and backpack.

**End Conditions**: You win by reducing the killer's health to zero (depleting
all Health markers and the black Final Health token). You lose if the
killer slays your Final Girl. In the rare case both die simultaneously,
you win.

### Key Design Patterns

GENRE SIMULATION AS DESIGN FRAMEWORK: Final Girl's most transferable
insight is that genre conventions can serve as a structural blueprint for
game design. Rather than inventing mechanical systems from scratch and then
applying a theme, Derrick and Porfirio started with the question: what does
a horror movie feel like, and what mechanical systems would reproduce that
feeling? The Horror track creates rising dread. The victim pool creates
urgency and guilt. The time limit creates the ticking clock. The killer AI
creates an unpredictable antagonist. None of these mechanics are novel in
isolation, but their combination is precisely calibrated to a specific genre
experience. This approach — designing from genre backwards to mechanics —
is underutilized in the hobby and produces unusually coherent thematic games.

SOLO-ONLY DESIGN COMMITMENT: Most solo board games are multiplayer designs
with an automa bolted on. Final Girl inverts this: it is designed from the
ground up for exactly one player, and every system reflects this. There is
no need for turn order mechanisms, information hiding between players, or
balanced player powers. The entire decision space belongs to you, which
means the designers can tune difficulty, pacing, and narrative arc with
precision impossible in multiplayer designs. The result is a game that feels
authored in the way a video game campaign feels authored — the experience
is curated, not negotiated between players. This design commitment is rare
and valuable: it demonstrates that solo tabletop gaming is a legitimate
design space, not a consolation mode.

MODULAR FEATURE FILM SYSTEM: The killer-plus-location box structure is a
masterclass in content architecture. The core rules are constant across
all combinations, but each Feature Film box adds a killer deck, location
map, item deck, and event deck that transform the play experience. This
modularity serves three purposes: it provides combinatorial replayability
(any killer works with any location), it allows thematic variety without
rules bloat, and it creates a collectible expansion model that does not
require power creep. Each box is self-contained and laterally different
rather than vertically superior. The design lesson is that content
modularity, when built on a stable mechanical chassis, can provide
variety without complexity inflation.

HORROR TRACK AND BLOODLUST AS DUAL ESCALATION: The game uses two
separate escalation systems. The Horror track (a circular dial on the
player board) determines how many dice you roll on Horror Rolls — higher
Horror means more dice, making actions more likely to succeed but also
more volatile. The Bloodlust track (on the killer board) rises when
victims die, directly increasing the killer's Movement Value and Attack
Value while unlocking special effects and Dark Power cards at thresholds.
Saving victims slows Bloodlust's rise by reducing Horror. The Horror
Level can go both up and down through card effects, but Bloodlust only
increases — it is the true one-directional ratchet. This dual-track
system means the killer grows objectively stronger over time while the
player's dice odds shift in a more nuanced way.

VICTIM RESCUE AS SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: The victims scattered across the
map serve a dual mechanical purpose. They are secondary objectives
— saving them earns rewards (shown on the Final Girl card, such as
items or bonus movement) and reduces Horror. But they are also
the killer's primary targets, which means they create geographic pressure.
You cannot simply hunt the killer; you must also protect the vulnerable.
This creates the classic horror movie dilemma: do you run toward the
danger to fight, or toward the victims to save? The design achieves
branching strategic paths without branching rules, because the tension
between offense and rescue emerges from the spatial relationship between
player, killer, and victims.

TIME AS DEPLETING RESOURCE: The time track imposes a hard limit on the
game's length, but more importantly, it creates urgency that shapes every
decision. Searching for items costs time. Moving to save victims costs
time. Every action that is not directly attacking the killer brings you
closer to the deadline. This forces the push-your-luck element into every
turn: do you spend time preparing for a stronger attack, or do you engage
the killer now with inferior resources? The time pressure prevents the
optimal-play paralysis that plagues many solo games, because waiting for
the perfect moment means running out of moments entirely.

KILLER AI BEHAVIOR DECK: Rather than using a simple algorithm for the
killer's movement and actions, Final Girl gives each killer a dedicated
Terror deck (shuffled together with the location's Terror cards) that
functions as a behavioral AI. Cards dictate movement patterns, special
attacks, victim targeting, and environmental effects.
This means the killer's behavior is probabilistic rather than deterministic
— you can anticipate likely actions but never predict exactly what will
happen. Different killers feel genuinely different to play against: a
stalking killer moves slowly but hits hard, a swarming killer spawns
minions, a supernatural killer teleports. The deck-as-AI approach creates
personality without complexity, and it is the primary mechanism that makes
each Feature Film box feel distinct.

HORROR PHASES RECREATING MOVIE TENSION ARC: The game's structure naturally
produces a three-act horror narrative. The early phase is exploration and
preparation (searching, positioning, saving nearby victims). The middle
phase is escalation (terror rising, victims dying, resources depleting).
The finale is confrontation (direct combat with the killer, using
accumulated items and finale cards). This arc is not hardcoded — it
emerges from the interaction of the Horror track, Bloodlust track, victim
pool, Time track, and card economy. The designers built systems that naturally
converge toward a climax, which is why Final Girl consistently produces
satisfying narrative experiences despite being a mechanically driven game.

### What Makes It #97

Final Girl earns its place by proving that solo-only design is not a niche
concession but a legitimate creative space with unique advantages. The
game's tight thematic coherence — where every mechanism serves the horror
movie fantasy — is only possible because the designers refused to
compromise with multiplayer accommodations. The modular Feature Film
system provides the replayability that solo games desperately need without
sacrificing the curated experience that makes each session feel like a
complete story. In a hobby that often treats theme as wallpaper, Final
Girl treats it as architecture.
