## Design Notes

Designer: Evan Derrick & A. J. Porfirio. Published by Van Ryder Games (2021).

### Theme Integration

Final Girl is one of the rare modern board games that commits fully to genre
simulation as its core design thesis. The game does not borrow horror movie
aesthetics as decoration — it reverse-engineers the narrative structure of
slasher films and rebuilds it as a solo decision space. The "final girl"
trope, originating in Carol Clover's analysis of horror cinema, describes
the last surviving character who confronts the killer. Derrick and Porfirio
recognized that this trope is inherently a solo experience: one protagonist,
alone, against overwhelming odds. The design commitment to solo-only play
is not a limitation but a thematic necessity. Adding cooperative or
competitive modes would break the fundamental premise.

The game's emotional arc mirrors a horror film's three-act structure with
remarkable fidelity. The early game feels like the first act: victims are
scattered across the location, the killer prowls but has not yet reached
full power, and you spend time preparing — gathering items, positioning
yourself, saving victims. The midgame escalates as victims die, the terror
track rises, and the killer's behavior becomes more aggressive. The endgame
narrows to the final confrontation: just you and the killer, resources
depleted, dice rolls carrying life-or-death stakes. This is not scripted;
it emerges from the mechanical systems. The terror track, victim pool, and
killer AI conspire to produce the same narrative shape every time, while
the specific details vary. It is procedural horror storytelling.

The Feature Film box system — where each release pairs a killer with a
location — extends the cinematic metaphor. You are not playing a single
game; you are selecting which horror movie to watch tonight. Mixing Hans,
the camp counselor killer, with the summer camp location recreates Friday
the 13th. Pairing the alien entity with the space station evokes Alien.
Each killer has unique AI behaviors, special powers, and a dedicated terror
card deck, while each location has its own map, item deck, event deck, and
victims. The interchangeability of killers and locations means the system
generates combinatorial variety the way a film studio might remix subgenres:
slasher meets haunted house, creature feature meets suburbia.

### Core Loop

Each round follows a structured sequence that maps to the rhythm of a horror
movie scene:

**1. ACTION PHASE (Your Turn)**

You have a pool of action points (typically starting at 4-5, modified by
cards and the terror level). Spend action points on:

1. MOVE — Move to an adjacent location space on the map. Movement is
   constrained by the map's layout, creating chokepoints and dead ends
   that replicate horror geography.
2. SEARCH — Draw cards from the location's item deck. Items provide dice
   manipulation, one-time effects, and combat bonuses. Searching costs
   time and position.
3. SAVE A VICTIM — If you are in the same space as a victim and there is
   a safe route, spend action points to escort them to safety. Saved
   victims reduce the killer's power and score points.
4. ATTACK — Initiate combat with the killer if in the same space. Roll
   dice against the killer's health, modified by items, cards, and
   special abilities. Combat is the primary push-your-luck element:
   spending more action points on attacks increases damage potential but
   leaves fewer points for defense and movement.
5. PLAY CARDS — Use action cards from your hand for special effects:
   setting traps, healing, repositioning, gaining bonus dice.

**2. KILLER PHASE (AI Turn)**

1. Draw and resolve a terror card from the killer's deck. These cards
   move the killer, trigger special abilities, kill victims, raise the
   terror track, or spawn new threats. Each killer's terror deck has
   unique cards reflecting their personality and methods.
2. The killer moves toward the nearest victim (or toward you, depending
   on the killer's behavior rules and the current terror level).
3. If the killer occupies the same space as a victim, the victim dies.
   Dead victims raise the terror track and may trigger additional
   killer powers.

**3. UPKEEP**

1. Advance the time track. If time runs out, you lose.
2. Check terror level — higher terror unlocks more powerful killer
   abilities, reduces your action points, and accelerates victim deaths.
3. Replenish your hand from the finale deck (special powerful cards that
   become available as the game escalates).

**End Conditions**: You win by reducing the killer's health to zero. You
lose if the time track runs out, the terror track maxes out, or your
final girl is killed.

### Key Design Patterns

GENRE SIMULATION AS DESIGN FRAMEWORK: Final Girl's most transferable
insight is that genre conventions can serve as a structural blueprint for
game design. Rather than inventing mechanical systems from scratch and then
applying a theme, Derrick and Porfirio started with the question: what does
a horror movie feel like, and what mechanical systems would reproduce that
feeling? The terror track creates rising dread. The victim pool creates
urgency and guilt. The time limit creates the ticking clock. The killer AI
creates an unpredictable antagonist. None of these mechanics are novel in
isolation, but their combination is precisely calibrated to a specific genre
experience. This approach — designing from genre backwards to mechanics —
is underutilized in the hobby and produces unusually coherent thematic games.

SOLO-ONLY DESIGN COMMITMENT: Most solo board games are multiplayer designs
with an automa bolted on. Final Girl inverts this: it is designed from the
ground up for exactly one player, and every system reflects this. There is
no need for turn order mechanisms, information hiding between players, or
balanced player powers. The entire decision space belongs to you, which
means the designers can tune difficulty, pacing, and narrative arc with
precision impossible in multiplayer designs. The result is a game that feels
authored in the way a video game campaign feels authored — the experience
is curated, not negotiated between players. This design commitment is rare
and valuable: it demonstrates that solo tabletop gaming is a legitimate
design space, not a consolation mode.

MODULAR FEATURE FILM SYSTEM: The killer-plus-location box structure is a
masterclass in content architecture. The core rules are constant across
all combinations, but each Feature Film box adds a killer deck, location
map, item deck, and event deck that transform the play experience. This
modularity serves three purposes: it provides combinatorial replayability
(any killer works with any location), it allows thematic variety without
rules bloat, and it creates a collectible expansion model that does not
require power creep. Each box is self-contained and laterally different
rather than vertically superior. The design lesson is that content
modularity, when built on a stable mechanical chassis, can provide
variety without complexity inflation.

TERROR TRACK AS ESCALATION TIMER: The terror track is the game's central
pacing mechanism. It rises when victims die, when certain terror cards
trigger, and when specific events occur. As it rises, the killer becomes
more powerful (unlocking new abilities at thresholds), the player becomes
weaker (losing action points), and the emotional tension increases. The
terror track is not a countdown — it is a pressure gauge that the player
can partially control. Saving victims slows its rise. Killing the killer
early keeps it low. But it never decreases, so even successful play
accumulates pressure. This one-directional ratchet is an elegant model
for escalation: things always get worse, the question is how fast.

VICTIM RESCUE AS SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: The victims scattered across the
map serve a dual mechanical purpose. They are secondary scoring objectives
— saving them earns rewards and slows the terror track. But they are also
the killer's primary targets, which means they create geographic pressure.
You cannot simply hunt the killer; you must also protect the vulnerable.
This creates the classic horror movie dilemma: do you run toward the
danger to fight, or toward the victims to save? The design achieves
branching strategic paths without branching rules, because the tension
between offense and rescue emerges from the spatial relationship between
player, killer, and victims.

TIME AS DEPLETING RESOURCE: The time track imposes a hard limit on the
game's length, but more importantly, it creates urgency that shapes every
decision. Searching for items costs time. Moving to save victims costs
time. Every action that is not directly attacking the killer brings you
closer to the deadline. This forces the push-your-luck element into every
turn: do you spend time preparing for a stronger attack, or do you engage
the killer now with inferior resources? The time pressure prevents the
optimal-play paralysis that plagues many solo games, because waiting for
the perfect moment means running out of moments entirely.

KILLER AI BEHAVIOR DECK: Rather than using a simple algorithm for the
killer's movement and actions, Final Girl gives each killer a dedicated
terror deck that functions as a behavioral AI. Cards dictate movement
patterns, special attacks, victim targeting, and environmental effects.
This means the killer's behavior is probabilistic rather than deterministic
— you can anticipate likely actions but never predict exactly what will
happen. Different killers feel genuinely different to play against: a
stalking killer moves slowly but hits hard, a swarming killer spawns
minions, a supernatural killer teleports. The deck-as-AI approach creates
personality without complexity, and it is the primary mechanism that makes
each Feature Film box feel distinct.

HORROR PHASES RECREATING MOVIE TENSION ARC: The game's structure naturally
produces a three-act horror narrative. The early phase is exploration and
preparation (searching, positioning, saving nearby victims). The middle
phase is escalation (terror rising, victims dying, resources depleting).
The finale is confrontation (direct combat with the killer, using
accumulated items and finale cards). This arc is not hardcoded — it
emerges from the interaction of the terror track, victim pool, time
track, and card economy. The designers built systems that naturally
converge toward a climax, which is why Final Girl consistently produces
satisfying narrative experiences despite being a mechanically driven game.

### What Makes It #97

Final Girl earns its place by proving that solo-only design is not a niche
concession but a legitimate creative space with unique advantages. The
game's tight thematic coherence — where every mechanism serves the horror
movie fantasy — is only possible because the designers refused to
compromise with multiplayer accommodations. The modular Feature Film
system provides the replayability that solo games desperately need without
sacrificing the curated experience that makes each session feel like a
complete story. In a hobby that often treats theme as wallpaper, Final
Girl treats it as architecture.
