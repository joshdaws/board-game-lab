### Theme Integration

Wonderland's War transposes Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland into a darker,
more combative register --- a Tim Burton-inflected vision where the familiar
characters of Wonderland have splintered into warring factions. The Cheshire Cat,
the Mad Hatter, the Queen of Hearts, Alice, and the Jabberwock are not whimsical
figures here but rival leaders competing for control of Wonderland's regions. The
thematic reframing is mechanically generative: each leader has unique asymmetric
powers that express their character through gameplay. The Cheshire Cat manipulates
information and misdirection; the Queen of Hearts excels at aggressive area
control; the Mad Hatter introduces chaos into structured systems. The theme is
not a veneer over abstract mechanics --- it shapes how each character interacts
with the game's systems, creating playstyle diversity that is both thematically
coherent and mechanically distinct.

The tea party --- Carroll's most iconic scene --- becomes the game's drafting phase.
Players sit around a shared rondel representing the tea table, taking turns moving
clockwise to draft cards, recruit allies, and acquire resources. The rondel
structure evokes the circular, never-ending nature of Carroll's original tea
party, where guests shift seats endlessly. Mechanically, the rondel constrains
drafting choices by limiting how far players can move each turn, creating tension
between reaching a desirable card and conserving movement for future rounds.
The transformation of a literary scene into a mechanical structure is one of the
game's most successful design choices --- it grounds the abstract rondel mechanic
in a narrative context that players intuitively understand.

The war phase --- where players draw chips from a bag to resolve area control
battles --- draws on the Wonderland theme of madness. Madness chips lurk in each
player's bag alongside combat chips. Drawing a madness chip can cause a bust,
ending your contribution to a battle prematurely. The push-your-luck mechanic
models the instability of Wonderland itself: power in this world is never fully
controllable, and pressing too hard risks losing everything to madness. The
tension between drawing one more chip for additional strength and the risk of
busting captures the tonal essence of Carroll's world --- a place where logic
operates by its own irrational rules.

### Core Loop

The game plays over three rounds, each consisting of two distinct phases:

**PHASE 1 --- THE TEA PARTY (Drafting via Rondel)**

1. Players take turns in clockwise order, each moving their character token
   forward along the tea party rondel (1-3 spaces).
2. At the space where you stop, you take the available action. Tea party spaces
   offer various options:
   - RECRUIT: Add a Wonderlandian ally card to your war deck, gaining their
     combat value and special ability for future battles
   - GATHER CHIPS: Add combat chips to your bag, improving your battle odds
   - ACQUIRE RESOURCES: Gain coins, swords, or other resources needed for
     battle deployment and tower construction
   - PLACE TOWERS: Build towers in Wonderland regions to establish area
     control presence before battles begin
   - SPECIAL ACTIONS: Character-specific rondel effects that leverage your
     leader's unique powers
3. The tea party continues around the table until all players have exhausted
   their movement points for the round.

**PHASE 2 --- WAR (Bag Building / Push Your Luck Area Control)**

1. Battles occur sequentially at each contested region of Wonderland. A region
   is contested if two or more players have presence (towers, troops, or
   committed forces) there.
2. For each battle, involved players take turns drawing chips one at a time
   from their personal bag. Each chip drawn adds to your battle strength:
   - Combat chips add their printed value to your total
   - Special chips trigger abilities (remove opponent chips, add resources, etc.)
   - MADNESS CHIPS cause a bust --- if drawn, your battle total is wiped and
     you are eliminated from this battle. Madness chips remain in your bag
     once added and can only be removed through specific card abilities.
3. After each chip draw, the active player decides: draw another chip (risking
   madness) or stop (locking in current battle value). Players take turns
   drawing until all have stopped or busted.
4. The player with the highest total strength in each region gains area control
   bonuses: victory points, resources, and regional effects. Second place may
   receive lesser rewards.

**BETWEEN ROUNDS**

- Score region control bonuses
- Resolve end-of-round events
- Reset the tea party rondel for the next round
- Drafted allies and acquired chips persist across rounds, building momentum

**GAME END** --- After three rounds of tea party and war, final scoring combines
area control points, set bonuses from recruited Wonderlandians, remaining
resources, and leader-specific scoring conditions.

### Key Design Patterns

RONDEL DRAFTING AS CONSTRAINED CHOICE: The tea party rondel imposes a spatial
constraint on drafting that distinguishes Wonderland's War from open-market draft
systems. Players can only move 1-3 spaces forward each turn, meaning they cannot
always reach the most desirable option. This forces tradeoffs between taking a
good-but-near option now versus spending extra movement to reach a better option
later, knowing that movement points are finite. The rondel also creates indirect
player interaction: advancing past other players' positions changes what is
available to them, and monitoring opponents' positions on the rondel informs
whether a desired resource will still be available when your turn comes. The
circular structure ensures that the draft wraps around, creating a flowing
rhythm rather than the hard stops of linear draft systems.

BAG BUILDING AS PUSH-YOUR-LUCK ENGINE: The battle resolution system uses bag
building --- a physical, tactile variant of deck building where players add chips
to a cloth bag and draw them randomly during battles. Unlike deck building, bag
building has no discard-and-reshuffle cycle; every chip in your bag is available
every battle, but the draw is random. This mechanic interacts with push-your-luck
brilliantly: each additional draw improves your battle strength but increases the
probability of drawing a madness chip. The bag's physical nature also adds a
sensory dimension absent from card-based systems --- the rattle of chips, the
tactile uncertainty of blind draws, and the dramatic reveal of each chip all
contribute to battle tension. The madness chips are not merely penalties; they
are an ever-present contamination that players must manage through careful chip
acquisition and specific removal abilities.

MADNESS AS PERSISTENT CONTAMINATION: Madness chips, once added to your bag,
cannot be easily removed. They persist across rounds, accumulating as the game
progresses. Certain events, failed battles, and specific game effects add madness
chips, gradually degrading a player's combat reliability. This persistence
creates a long-term strategic concern: a player who pushes aggressively in early
battles and accumulates madness will find late-game battles increasingly
dangerous. The madness mechanic also creates differentiation between players ---
a clean bag can afford aggressive draws, while a contaminated bag must play
conservatively. Crucially, madness chips do not trigger automatically; they only
bust you if drawn, meaning a contaminated bag still has a chance at aggressive
play. The probability management of a gradually contaminating bag is the game's
deepest strategic layer.

PHASE SEPARATION AS GENRE FUSION: The clean division between the tea party
(Euro-style rondel drafting) and war (Ameritrash-style area control with push
your luck) exemplifies a design trend of fusing traditionally separate genre
sensibilities within a single game. The tea party phase rewards optimization,
planning, and resource efficiency --- hallmarks of Euro design. The war phase
rewards risk assessment, dramatic moments, and direct confrontation ---
hallmarks of Ameritrash design. By separating these modes into distinct phases
rather than interleaving them, Wonderland's War allows each to operate with its
own logic without creating tonal whiplash. The preparation-then-execution
structure also mirrors the game's thematic arc: the calm before the storm.

ASYMMETRIC LEADER POWERS AS IDENTITY: Each playable character (Alice, Cheshire
Cat, Queen of Hearts, Mad Hatter, Jabberwock) has unique abilities that modify
both the tea party and war phases. These asymmetric powers are not cosmetic
variations; they create meaningfully different strategic approaches. A leader
whose power manipulates the bag composition plays a different game than one
whose power controls area presence before battles begin. The asymmetry also
increases replayability by ensuring that each character creates a different
strategic puzzle even when playing against the same opponents on the same
board. The Wonderland theme makes asymmetry feel natural --- of course the
Cheshire Cat plays differently from the Queen of Hearts --- providing thematic
justification for mechanical differentiation.

TOWER PLACEMENT AS PRE-BATTLE POSITIONING: Before battles resolve, players can
build towers in Wonderland regions during the tea party phase. Towers establish
area control presence independently of battle outcomes, meaning that a player
can influence region scoring through strategic tower placement even without
winning the battle itself. Towers also provide defensive bonuses during battles,
creating an investment that pays dividends across both phases. The pre-battle
positioning game adds a strategic layer that pure push-your-luck combat would
lack --- battles are not won solely by lucky draws but by the preparation that
precedes them.

### What Makes It #134

Wonderland's War succeeds by marrying two mechanical traditions that rarely
coexist gracefully. The Euro-style rondel drafting phase provides the strategic
planning and optimization that weight 3.05 players expect, while the bag-
building push-your-luck battle phase delivers the dramatic tension and direct
confrontation that area control demands. The madness mechanic ties everything
together: chips acquired during the careful drafting phase determine the
probabilities during the chaotic battle phase, ensuring that preparation and
execution are causally linked rather than merely sequential. The Wonderland
theme elevates what could be an abstract mechanical exercise into a narrative
experience where madness, tea parties, and territorial war coexist with the
same irrational logic that Carroll himself would recognize. At its best,
Wonderland's War captures the feeling of a world where careful plans collide
with glorious chaos --- a tea party that ends in war, resolved by the luck
of the draw and the courage to reach into the bag one more time.
