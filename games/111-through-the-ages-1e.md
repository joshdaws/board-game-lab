## Design Notes

Designer: Vlaada Chvátil. Published by Czech Board Games (2006). This is the first edition of the game later revised and rebalanced as *Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization* (2015), which appears at #16 in the BGG rankings.

### Theme Integration

Through the Ages condenses the entire arc of human civilization into a card game
with no board. Players guide a society from Antiquity through the Modern Age,
developing technologies, electing leaders, constructing wonders, and building
military forces. The theme operates entirely through abstraction: farms and mines
are cards that produce food and resources, laboratories generate science, and
temples and theaters generate culture. There is no map, no spatial dimension at
all. Civilization is represented as a tableau of interconnected production chains,
and the sweep of history is felt through the progression of four ages with
increasingly powerful cards that obsolete earlier investments.

Historical leaders like Alexander the Great, Napoleon, and Einstein appear as cards
whose abilities reflect their real-world legacies. Wonders from the Pyramids to
the Internet provide permanent bonuses that echo their historical significance.
The original 2006 edition embraced a more aggressive military posture than its
successor; aggressions and wars were more punishing, and the military balance
was less forgiving of pacifist strategies. Events seeded by players into a shared
future deck created a sense of narrative unpredictability, as players shaped the
political landscape their civilizations would navigate. The entire design rests on
Chvátil's conviction that the essence of civilization building is not territory but
resource allocation under scarcity.

### Core Loop

Each turn follows a fixed sequence with all action points spent within the turn:

1. CARD ROW MAINTENANCE - The oldest cards (leftmost positions) are removed from
   the card row, remaining cards shift left, and new cards from the current age
   deck fill the rightmost (most expensive) positions. This aging mechanism means
   cards become cheaper over time but risk being discarded or taken first.
2. POLITICAL ACTION PHASE - Play at most one political action: seed an event card
   onto the future events deck, launch an aggression against another player,
   declare a war (which resolves next round), or play a territory card. In the
   original edition, aggressions are particularly devastating, as military bonuses
   from tactics cards can create large power swings.
3. CIVIL AND MILITARY ACTIONS - Spend civil action points on: taking cards from
   the card row (cost varies by position), increasing population (pay food),
   building or upgrading structures, constructing wonder stages, playing action
   cards, or changing government (revolution costs all civil actions). Spend
   military action points on: building or upgrading military units, or playing
   tactics cards to organize armies.
4. END OF TURN - Discard excess military cards. Production Phase: score culture
   and science from your tableau, check corruption (lose resources if storage
   overflows), produce food from farms, pay consumption from population, produce
   resources from mines. Draw military cards based on unused military actions.

Victory: The player with the most culture points at the end of Age III wins.
Culture accumulates each turn from production, events, wonders, and end-game
scoring bonuses.

### Key Design Patterns

CARD ROW AS TEMPORAL MARKET: The card row is the game's central innovation and
its most distinctive mechanism. Cards enter at the rightmost position (costing 3
civil actions to draft) and slide left as older cards are removed each turn. A
powerful card might cost 3 actions when it appears but only 1 action two turns
later — if no one takes it first and if it survives the discard of aging cards.
This transforms the traditional marketplace into a time-pressure system where
patience is rewarded but carries real risk. Players constantly weigh the cost of
immediate acquisition against the gamble of waiting, knowing opponents face the
same calculation. The card row replaces spatial exploration with temporal economy.

SEPARATE ACTION ECONOMIES: Civil and military actions form distinct, non-fungible
resource pools. Your government type determines how many of each you receive,
creating a fundamental strategic identity. Despotism provides 4 civil and 2
military; other governments like Republic, Monarchy, and Democracy offer different
ratios with unique bonuses. The separation forces genuine strategic commitment:
you cannot simply convert economic surplus into military strength or vice versa.
Changing government via revolution costs all civil actions for the turn, making
the transition a major tempo sacrifice. This dual-economy design ensures that
even the most peaceful player must consider military action budgets, since unused
military actions generate military card draws.

TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE ACROSS AGES: Technologies span four ages (A through III),
with each generation strictly superior to the last. An Age I Farm produces less
food per worker than an Age II Farm, but upgrading requires civil actions and
resources for each worker moved to the new technology. The original edition's
age transitions were notably punishing: when an age deck depleted, antiquated
cards from two ages prior were forcibly removed from tableaus, stranding workers
and eliminating leaders. This obsolescence pressure created a relentless
modernization imperative that rewarded players who invested early in science
to access higher-age technologies before competitors.

CORRUPTION AS ANTI-HOARDING MECHANISM: The resource storage system uses a bank
of blue tokens with limited capacity. When production exceeds storage, corruption
eats the surplus — exposed negative numbers on the bank track represent waste.
This mechanism elegantly prevents indefinite resource accumulation, forcing
players into a cycle of production and immediate spending. The original edition's
corruption was harsher than the revised version, making efficient engine cycling
even more critical. Players who produced heavily but failed to reinvest promptly
lost substantial value to waste.

MILITARY AS ASYMMETRIC LEVERAGE: In the original edition, military was
disproportionately powerful compared to the 2015 revision. Aggressions allowed
stronger players to steal resources, science, or population from weaker
opponents, and the bonus card system meant that a well-timed tactics card could
create devastating power swings. Wars, declared a round in advance, created
tense buildups as both sides scrambled to assemble strength. Events seeded into
the future deck often rewarded the militarily strongest player or punished the
weakest, creating indirect pressure to maintain competitive forces. The severity
of military consequences in the original edition was a key criticism that drove
the 2015 rebalancing.

HAPPINESS AS POPULATION GOVERNOR: Every idle worker not assigned to a technology
card creates unrest. Your happiness rating — from temples, theaters, and certain
wonders — must meet or exceed your idle worker count. If discontent workers
outnumber happiness, your entire Production Phase is skipped: no science, no
culture, no food, no resources. This catastrophic penalty acts as a hard
population cap, preventing players from expanding their workforce beyond their
cultural infrastructure. It also elevates seemingly low-priority entertainment
buildings into strategic necessities.

PLAYER-DRIVEN EVENT NARRATIVE: Events are not random occurrences but deliberate
player choices. When you play an event card as your political action, it enters
a face-down future events deck and scores you culture immediately. Current events
trigger when the current deck depletes and the future deck becomes active.
Military-focused players seed events rewarding high strength; culture-focused
players seed events rewarding cultural output. This system means the political
landscape is shaped by player strategy, creating emergent narrative arcs where
the consequences of earlier decisions ripple forward unpredictably.

LEADERS AND WONDERS AS ERA DEFINITION: Each age offers exclusive leaders and
wonders that cannot coexist — you may have only one leader and one wonder under
construction at a time. Leaders provide powerful ongoing effects for an era but
are replaced when you draft a new one or when age transitions antiquate them.
Wonders require multi-turn resource investment but grant permanent benefits.
The exclusivity forces painful drafting decisions: taking a leader denies it to
all opponents, and the card row's aging means desired wonders may vanish before
you can afford them.

### What Makes It #111

Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization is the raw, uncompromising original
vision that would later be refined into the more widely acclaimed "New Story"
edition at #16. The 2006 design established the card-row temporal market, the
split action economy, and the boardless civilization-as-tableau concept that
made the system revolutionary. Its higher weight (4.38 vs. 4.44 for the revision,
despite the revision adding content) reflects a game where military imbalances
and harsher corruption made recovery from mistakes more difficult. The original
edition rewards experienced players who understand the asymmetric military
dynamics and can navigate the more punishing age transitions. It remains ranked
in the top 111 because the core design — civilization as pure resource-allocation
puzzle — is fundamentally brilliant, even if the 2015 edition smoothed its
roughest edges. For players who prefer higher stakes and sharper teeth in their
civilization games, the original Through the Ages remains the definitive version.
