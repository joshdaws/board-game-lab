## Design Notes

Designer: Ryan Laukat. Published by Red Raven Games (2021).

### Theme Integration

Sleeping Gods places players aboard the steamship Manticore in the year 1929,
crewed by Captain Odessa Saito and her diverse crew, who have been transported
to a strange and unfamiliar world. The objective is not conquest or optimization
but survival and discovery -- find the totems of the sleeping gods scattered
across the map so you can return home. This premise is not a framing device for
a mechanical engine; it is the game itself. Every session is defined by the
question "where do we go next?" and the answer is never dictated by game
mechanics but by player curiosity, narrative threads, and strategic assessment
of risk versus reward.

Laukat's world-building operates on a principle of invitation rather than
instruction. The map is visible from the start -- a vast archipelago of islands,
coastlines, forests, and cities -- but nothing tells you where to go first.
There are no waypoints, no quest markers, no suggested paths. You see a
mysterious tower on a distant island and you can simply sail there. You
encounter a village and can choose to help, ignore, or exploit its inhabitants.
The narrative consequences of these choices ripple forward through the campaign,
altering which storylines are available, which allies you gain, and which
threats you face. The storybook paragraph system delivers these consequences
through hundreds of numbered entries, creating a branching narrative that no
single campaign can fully explore.

The crew of the Manticore grounds the adventure in human stakes. Each crew
member is a named character with specific abilities, health tracks, and
equipment slots. When crew members take damage, their abilities degrade. When a
crew member is knocked out, the ship loses that person's contribution entirely
until they recover. This personal connection to the crew transforms abstract hit
points into emotional investment -- you care about protecting the ship's
navigator not because of their mechanical value (though that matters) but
because they have been with you for ten sessions and you have equipped them with
gear found on a remote island three hours ago.

### Core Loop

Sleeping Gods is a campaign game played across multiple sessions. Each session
follows an ongoing cycle until players choose to stop, the event deck runs out,
or the ship's situation becomes untenable. The turn structure within a session
proceeds as follows:

1. DRAW EVENT - Draw and resolve an event card. Events introduce narrative
   complications, resource drains, combat encounters, or opportunities. The
   event deck serves as the campaign's clock -- when it empties, the campaign
   scores and may end or continue based on player choice.
2. SPEND ACTION POINTS - The crew has a shared pool of action points (typically
   7-9 based on crew health and abilities). Players collectively decide how to
   allocate these points across available actions:
   - MOVE - Sail the Manticore to an adjacent sea zone (1 AP). Navigation
     across the map is literal -- you trace routes between connected zones.
   - EXPLORE - Visit a location on the current map tile. Read the
     corresponding storybook entry, which describes what you find and
     presents choices (2 AP).
   - MARKET - Buy or sell equipment, resources, or provisions at a port
     (1 AP).
   - PREPARE - Recover crew health, reorganize equipment, or craft items
     (1 AP).
   - SPECIAL ACTIONS - Use location-specific or crew-specific abilities
     that become available through narrative progression.
3. RESOLVE ENCOUNTERS - If exploration or events trigger combat, resolve it
   using the card-row targeting system. Players draw from a shared adventure
   deck and assign damage to specific hit zones on enemy cards. Combat is
   cooperative and tactical, requiring coordination of crew abilities and
   equipment.
4. MANAGE RESOURCES - After actions are spent, manage the ship's provisions
   (food and fuel), crew health, and equipment. Insufficient provisions force
   difficult choices about rationing or emergency stops.
5. SAVE AND CONTINUE - At any point, players may save the campaign state (using
   a save system with baggies for components) and resume later. A campaign
   typically spans 10-20 hours across multiple sessions.

The campaign ends when players have collected enough totems to attempt a final
confrontation, or when the event deck has been cycled a set number of times.
Final scoring evaluates totems found, quests completed, challenges overcome, and
crew survival.

### Key Design Patterns

OPEN-WORLD EXPLORATION IN A BOARD GAME: Sleeping Gods' most significant design
contribution is proving that open-world exploration -- a staple of video games
-- is viable in a physical board game format. The entire map is visible and
accessible from the start. There are no locked regions, no level gates, no
prescribed sequence. A first-session crew can sail to the far corner of the map
if they are willing to risk the journey without proper provisions. This openness
creates a feeling of genuine freedom that is vanishingly rare in board games,
where most exploration mechanics are guided or gated. The design trade-off is
that players can miss enormous amounts of content -- entire storylines, powerful
items, and crucial narrative context -- by choosing different paths. Laukat
embraces this incompleteness as a feature, making each campaign a unique story
rather than a completionist checklist.

STORYBOOK PARAGRAPH SYSTEM FOR NARRATIVE: The spiral-bound storybook contains
hundreds of numbered paragraphs, each describing a location, encounter, or
narrative branch. When players explore a location, they read the corresponding
entry, which presents the situation and usually offers choices. These choices
lead to other numbered entries, creating branching paths that feel genuinely
consequential. The system is not new -- it descends from Choose Your Own
Adventure books and the paragraph system in games like Agents of SMERSH and
Tales of the Arabian Nights -- but Laukat's implementation is distinguished by
its density and interconnection. Entries frequently reference earlier choices,
reward items found elsewhere on the map, or gate content behind relationships
established in previous sessions. The storybook is not a random encounter table;
it is a carefully authored narrative web.

SHIP MANAGEMENT AS SHARED RESOURCE: The Manticore is the central shared resource
that all players manage cooperatively. The ship requires provisions (food and
fuel) to operate, and running low on either creates escalating consequences.
Provisions are consumed over time and must be replenished at ports, creating a
logistical layer that interacts with the exploration layer -- you might want to
explore a remote island chain, but do you have enough supplies for the round
trip? The ship's status also affects available action points, as damaged or
exhausted crew contribute fewer points to the shared pool. This shared resource
creates natural cooperative tension, as players must balance individual desires
(exploring a personally interesting storyline) against collective needs
(restocking at the nearest port).

COMBAT AS CARD-ROW TARGETING: Sleeping Gods' combat system is distinctive for
its spatial specificity. Enemies are represented by cards with multiple hit
zones, each with a defense value and sometimes a special effect when struck.
Players draw cards from the adventure deck and use them to target specific hit
zones, attempting to destroy the enemy by eliminating all its zones or hitting a
critical weak point. Crew members contribute combat abilities based on their
equipment and health -- a damaged crew member fights less effectively. The
system is cooperative, with players coordinating which zones to target and when
to use limited special abilities. Combat is dangerous and resource-intensive,
creating a genuine risk-reward calculation around whether to fight or flee from
encounters.

CAMPAIGN SAVE AND RESUME SYSTEM: Sleeping Gods' campaign spans 10-20 hours, far
too long for a single sitting. The save system uses labeled bags and a campaign
log to preserve the game state between sessions -- crew health, equipment, map
progress, active quests, discovered locations, and remaining event deck. This
technical solution to a logistical problem is itself a design statement: Laukat
is asserting that a board game can demand the same time commitment as a video
game campaign, and players will accept this if the experience justifies it. The
save system's physical nature (bags of components rather than a digital save
file) introduces a tangible ritual that many players find satisfying -- packing
up the campaign state becomes part of the experience rather than an
interruption.

NON-LINEAR NARRATIVE STRUCTURE: The storybook's paragraph system enables a
narrative structure that is fundamentally non-linear. There is no Act 1, Act 2,
Act 3 -- or rather, each campaign creates its own act structure based on where
players choose to go and what they choose to investigate. Two groups playing
Sleeping Gods might have entirely different stories to tell, having explored
different islands, met different characters, and confronted different
challenges. Some narrative threads converge on shared endpoints (the totem
locations), but the paths to those endpoints are wildly divergent. This non-
linearity is the game's primary source of replayability and its strongest claim
to narrative sophistication. For designers, the key insight is that non-
linearity requires an enormous content investment (Laukat authored hundreds of
paragraphs for a single campaign), but the payoff is a game where player agency
feels genuine rather than illusory.

MAP AS INVITATION RATHER THAN CONSTRAINT: Most board games with maps use them as
constraints -- you can only move to adjacent spaces, you must follow prescribed
routes, certain areas are locked until conditions are met. Sleeping Gods inverts
this relationship. The map is a vast field of possibilities, and every visible
location is an invitation to visit. Mountains, forests, ruins, cities,
coastlines -- each has a corresponding storybook entry waiting to be read. The
map functions less like a game board and more like a picture book, where the
visual design communicates atmosphere, danger, and mystery. Players look at the
map and generate their own objectives: "What's in that ruined temple on the
eastern shore?" This self-directed motivation is more powerful than any quest
marker because it emerges from genuine curiosity rather than mechanical
incentive.

CREW HEALTH AS DEGRADING CAPABILITY: Each crew member has a health track, and as
they take damage, their capabilities diminish. A fully healthy navigator
provides maximum action points and powerful exploration abilities. A heavily
wounded navigator provides fewer action points and may lose access to abilities
entirely. When a crew member is knocked out, their contribution drops to zero
until they recover. This degradation mechanic creates a fundamentally different
relationship to damage than binary "alive or dead" systems. Every wound matters
incrementally, and the decision to push forward with a wounded crew versus
stopping to heal becomes a persistent strategic question. The mechanic also
creates emotional attachment -- you feel protective of your crew not in the
abstract but because their injuries directly impact your capabilities.

### What Makes It #70

Sleeping Gods is the most successful translation of video game open-world design
into the board game medium. Where most narrative board games funnel players
through pre-authored sequences, Sleeping Gods trusts players to create their own
journey through a rich, interconnected world. The campaign format demands
significant time investment, but the save system and session structure make that
investment manageable. The combat system provides tactical depth without
dominating the experience. The crew management system creates emotional stakes
that pure narrative games lack. And Laukat's storybook writing -- hundreds of
paragraphs authored by a single designer who also illustrated the entire game --
gives the world a coherent voice that multi-author projects rarely achieve. It
is not a perfect game: the event deck timer can feel punishing, combat can be
swingy, and the open-world freedom can leave unfocused groups directionless. But
for players who want a board game that feels like exploring a novel, Sleeping
Gods is without peer.
