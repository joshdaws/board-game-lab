### Theme Integration

Paladins of the West Kingdom is set in the turbulent western Frankish kingdom
circa 900 AD, where players take on the roles of noble defenders marshaling
workers to fortify the city, strengthen the faith, and extend political
influence. Unlike many worker placement games where the theme is a thin veneer
over cube-pushing, Paladins embeds its moral philosophy directly into the
mechanical design. The virtue-corruption axis is not a decorative track — it is
an economic system that measures the ethical cost of pragmatic decisions. Hiring
criminals and outsiders is cheap and efficient, but it corrodes your virtue and
incurs end-game penalties. Relying on townsfolk is more expensive and less
flexible, but it preserves your moral standing. The game asks players to weigh
ethical purity against operational efficiency, and the answer is never obvious.

The three development tracks — fortification, faith, and influence — map to the
three pillars of medieval power. Fortification represents military defense
against external threats. Faith represents the church's spiritual authority and
its entanglement with secular governance. Influence represents political
maneuvering within the aristocratic hierarchy. Each track scores independently,
and progressing on all three requires different worker types and resources. The
design does not privilege one form of power over another — a player who invests
heavily in faith can win just as convincingly as one who dominates fortification —
but the resource requirements for each track differ enough that genuine
specialization choices emerge. The thematic implication is that a realm's strength
depends on balanced development across military, spiritual, and political domains,
but any single pillar can carry the day if pursued with sufficient conviction.

The paladin cards themselves embody the theme of individual heroism within
systemic constraint. Each round, a new paladin arrives with a unique ability
that shapes that round's strategic possibilities. Paladins are not permanent
acquisitions — they serve for one round and depart — creating the feeling of
traveling champions whose brief presence reshapes the political landscape. This
transience mirrors the historical reality of itinerant knights and their
temporary allegiances, and it prevents players from building a permanent engine
that runs on autopilot.

### Core Loop

The game is played over seven rounds, each following the same structure:

1. PALADIN SELECTION — Each player simultaneously selects one paladin card
   from their hand of three. The chosen paladin provides a unique ability for
   the round plus an initial allocation of workers (of specific colors). The
   unchosen paladins return to the hand for future rounds, creating a
   hand-management layer across the full game.

2. WORKER ALLOCATION (MAIN PHASE) — Players take turns placing workers onto
   action spaces on the main board and their personal player boards. Each action
   space requires a specific number of workers and often requires specific
   worker colors. Available actions include:
   - FORTIFY — Place workers to advance on the fortification track. Requires
     specific worker colors and building materials.
   - CONVERT — Place workers to advance on the faith track. Often requires
     townsfolk (white workers) and provisions.
   - INFLUENCE — Place workers to advance on the influence track. Requires
     mixed worker types and political resources.
   - GARRISON — Place workers at outposts on the board for set collection
     bonuses and defensive rewards.
   - COMMISSION — Take on king's orders (objective cards) that provide
     bonus scoring for specific achievements.
   - RECRUIT — Gain additional workers from the general supply, choosing
     from townsfolk, outsiders, or criminals based on availability and need.
   - PRAY — Gain provisions, silver, or other basic resources.
   - ABSOLVE — Remove criminal or outsider workers to recover virtue, or
     convert workers to higher-value types.

3. ROUND CLEANUP — Resolve any end-of-round effects. Reveal new tavern
   workers and king's orders. Advance the round marker.

After seven rounds, final scoring combines position on all three development
tracks, fulfilled king's orders, garrison bonuses, remaining resources, and
virtue/corruption penalties.

### Key Design Patterns

WORKER COLOR AS FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION: The central design innovation is
that workers are not interchangeable. Paladins provides workers in multiple
colors — townsfolk (white), outsiders (blue/green/grey), and criminals (black) —
and each action space requires specific colors or combinations. Townsfolk are
the most versatile and morally safe, but they are scarce. Outsiders are more
plentiful and offer specific bonuses tied to their type, but they lower virtue.
Criminals are the cheapest and most available, but they carry the heaviest
virtue penalty. This system transforms worker placement from a spatial blocking
puzzle into a resource-matching puzzle: you might have access to an action space,
but unless you have the right color workers, you cannot use it. The design
insight is that differentiating workers by type rather than treating them as
generic units creates a second layer of constraint that makes each placement
decision richer without adding new mechanical systems.

PALADIN CARDS AS ROUND-SPECIFIC ABILITIES: Each round begins with the selection
of a paladin from a hand of cards, and the chosen paladin defines the round's
strategic landscape. Paladins provide an initial batch of specific-color workers,
a unique ability (discount on a track, extra actions, bonus resources), and
sometimes modify game rules for the round. Because paladins are selected from a
hand and unchosen cards remain for future rounds, the paladin selection is a
hand-management puzzle that spans the entire seven-round game. Choosing a
fortification-focused paladin in round two means that paladin is unavailable for
later rounds when fortification might be even more critical. The design pattern
is that round-specific ability cards create strategic arc planning — players must
sequence their capabilities across the game's temporal structure, not just
optimize within a single round.

VIRTUE VS. CORRUPTION AS MORAL ECONOMY: The virtue-corruption track runs from
high virtue (substantial end-game bonus) to deep corruption (substantial
end-game penalty), and nearly every worker placement decision nudges this
track. Hiring criminals pushes toward corruption. Using outsiders does the
same, though less severely. Absolution actions push back toward virtue. The
track is not binary — it is a spectrum with gradated scoring consequences,
meaning the marginal cost of each step into corruption increases as you sink
deeper. A player at mild corruption loses a few points; a player at deep
corruption loses many. This creates a non-linear penalty curve where the first
few compromises are cheap but subsequent ones become increasingly expensive.
The design wisdom is that moral systems in games are most interesting when
they function as economic trade-offs with escalating costs, not as binary
good-evil labels.

TAVERN WORKERS AS FLEXIBLE BUT COSTLY: The tavern is a special recruitment
area where players can hire workers of any color, but tavern workers come
with virtue penalties and sometimes monetary costs. The tavern represents the
pragmatic compromise at the heart of the game: you can always get the workers
you need if you are willing to pay the moral and financial price. This prevents
games from stalling due to worker scarcity while maintaining the virtue economy's
integrity. The design pattern is that a flexible but penalized resource source
serves as a pressure valve that keeps the game moving while preserving the
strategic weight of the primary acquisition channels.

THREE DEVELOPMENT TRACKS AS COMPETING INVESTMENT TARGETS: Fortification, faith,
and influence each offer escalating rewards as players advance, but all three
tracks compete for the same pool of workers, resources, and actions. Advancing
on one track necessarily means slower progress on the others, unless the player's
paladin or king's orders create temporary synergies. The tracks are not
independent scoring axes — they interact through shared resource pools and
worker requirements — but they are distinct enough that players can meaningfully
specialize. The design insight is that multiple parallel scoring tracks create
strategic diversity only when they share constrained inputs. If each track used
entirely different resources, they would be parallel games rather than competing
investment targets.

DEBT AS DELAYED PENALTY: Players can take on debt to gain immediate resources,
accepting negative end-game scoring in exchange for short-term liquidity. Debt
functions mechanically like a loan that is never repaid — it sits on your player
board as a permanent VP drain. The availability of debt prevents resource
scarcity from creating dead turns (a player who is completely broke can still
act by taking debt), but its end-game cost ensures that debt-fueled play is a
strategy of last resort rather than an optimal path. The design pattern is that
delayed penalties for immediate gains keep the game flowing while maintaining
long-term strategic consequences — they prevent both stalling and recklessness.

KING'S ORDERS AS DIRECTED OBJECTIVES: King's orders are objective cards that
specify conditions for bonus scoring (e.g., reach level 4 on two tracks, have
a specific combination of garrison placements). Players can commission one or
more orders during the game, and fulfilled orders provide significant end-game
points. Unfulfilled orders are not penalized, so taking an order is low-risk
but high-reward if you can steer your strategy to satisfy it. The design wisdom
is that optional directed objectives provide strategic scaffolding for players
who want guidance while leaving sandbox-style optimization available for
experienced players who prefer to navigate by VP efficiency rather than
prescribed goals.

OUTSIDER AND CRIMINAL WORKER TYPES: The game distinguishes between outsiders
(several subtypes with specific abilities) and criminals (universally flexible
but virtue-damaging). Each outsider type grants a small bonus when placed on
certain actions, incentivizing players to match outsider types to appropriate
tasks. Criminals provide no such bonuses but can substitute for almost any
worker type. This gradation — townsfolk (safe, scarce), outsiders (specialized,
mild penalty), criminals (flexible, heavy penalty) — creates a three-tier
resource system where the optimal choice depends on context. The design pattern
is that resource tiers with overlapping functionality but different side effects
create decision richness at the point of acquisition rather than the point of
expenditure.

### What Makes It #78

Paladins of the West Kingdom reinvents worker placement by making workers
non-fungible. In most worker placement games, a worker is a worker — the
strategy lies in where you place it. In Paladins, the strategy lies in which
worker you place, because color, type, and moral cost all matter. The paladin
selection system adds a hand-management arc that prevents the game from
becoming a round-by-round optimization exercise, and the virtue-corruption axis
gives every decision an ethical dimension that is mechanically consequential
rather than merely thematic. The result is a worker placement game that feels
heavier and more strategic than its mechanisms suggest, because the combinatorial
space of worker types, paladin abilities, and track advancement creates a
decision tree that is wider and deeper than the component count implies. It is
the rare euro that makes you feel the weight of your compromises.
