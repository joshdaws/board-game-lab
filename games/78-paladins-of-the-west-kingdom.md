## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Paladins of the West Kingdom is set in the turbulent western Frankish kingdom
circa 900 AD, where players take on the roles of noble defenders marshaling
workers to fortify the city, strengthen the faith, and extend political
influence. Unlike many worker placement games where the theme is a thin veneer
over cube-pushing, Paladins embeds its moral philosophy directly into the
mechanical design. The Suspicion system is not decorative — it is an economic mechanism that
measures the ethical cost of pragmatic decisions. Gaining Criminals (purple
workers that act as wilds) is efficient but generates Suspicion Cards that
carry end-game penalties. Relying on standard worker types is more constrained
but avoids accumulating Suspicion. The game asks players to weigh
ethical purity against operational efficiency, and the answer is never obvious.

The three development tracks — fortification, faith, and influence — map to the
three pillars of medieval power. Fortification represents military defense
against external threats. Faith represents the church's spiritual authority and
its entanglement with secular governance. Influence represents political
maneuvering within the aristocratic hierarchy. Each track scores independently,
and progressing on all three requires different worker types and resources. The
design does not privilege one form of power over another — a player who invests
heavily in faith can win just as convincingly as one who dominates fortification —
but the resource requirements for each track differ enough that genuine
specialization choices emerge. The thematic implication is that a realm's strength
depends on balanced development across military, spiritual, and political domains,
but any single pillar can carry the day if pursued with sufficient conviction.

The paladin cards themselves embody the theme of individual heroism within
systemic constraint. Each round, a new paladin arrives with a unique ability
that shapes that round's strategic possibilities. Paladins are not permanent
acquisitions — they serve for one round and depart — creating the feeling of
traveling champions whose brief presence reshapes the political landscape. This
transience mirrors the historical reality of itinerant knights and their
temporary allegiances, and it prevents players from building a permanent engine
that runs on autopilot.

### Core Loop

The game is played over seven rounds, each following the same structure:

1. PALADIN SELECTION — Each player draws the top three paladin cards from
   their personal draw pile. One is chosen for the current round, one is
   placed facedown on top of the draw pile (visible next round), and one is
   placed at the bottom. The chosen paladin provides 2 workers of specific
   colors, temporary attribute boosts, and a unique ability for the round.
   Players also select a Tavern Card that provides 4 additional workers.

2. WORKER ALLOCATION (MAIN PHASE) — Players take turns placing workers onto
   action spaces on the main board and their personal player boards. Each action
   space requires a specific number of workers and often requires specific
   worker colors. Available actions include:
   - FORTIFY — Place 3 workers (Merchant, any type, Scout) and pay Provisions
     to draw a Wall Card. Uses the Influence attribute. Rewards Strength.
   - GARRISON — Place 3 workers (Merchant, any type, Fighter) and pay
     Provisions to place an Outpost on the Main Board. Uses Strength.
   - COMMISSION — Place 3 workers (Scout, any type, Cleric) and pay
     Provisions to place a Monk on the Main Board. Uses Faith.
   - ABSOLVE — Place 3 workers (Cleric, any type, Merchant) and pay Silver
     to place a Jar, increase Faith, and remove a Suspicion Card.
   - ATTACK — Place 3 workers (Scout, any type, Fighter) to confront an
     Outsider Card using Strength.
   - CONVERT — Place workers to spend Influence and gain Faith on the Main
     Board track.
   - DEVELOP — Place 2 workers and pay Silver to add a Workshop, reducing
     future worker requirements for an action.
   - RECRUIT — Place workers to add a Townsfolk Card to your crew, gaining
     an ongoing ability.
   - PRAY — Place 1 Cleric and pay Silver to clear all workers from one
     action space, allowing reuse this round.
   - CONSPIRE — Place 1 worker to gain a Criminal (purple) and 1 Suspicion.

3. ROUND CLEANUP — Refresh the Main Board by discarding the rightmost
   Townsfolk and leftmost Outsider Cards, sliding the rest, and revealing
   new ones. Remove all Tavern Cards. Return workers from King's Favour
   Cards to the supply.

After seven rounds, final scoring combines VP from Outposts, Walls, Monks,
defeated Outsiders, King's Orders, King's Favours, attribute positions, Debt
penalties, and unresolved Suspicion penalties.

### Key Design Patterns

WORKER COLOR AS FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENTIATION: The central design innovation is
that workers are not interchangeable. Paladins provides workers in six types —
Labourers (grey), Scouts (green), Merchants (blue), Fighters (red), Clerics
(black), and Criminals (purple) — and each action space requires specific types
or combinations. Most actions require 3 workers of prescribed types, and
Criminals act as wilds that can fill any colored space. Transparent action
spaces accept any worker type, but colored spaces demand a specific match.
This system transforms worker placement from a spatial blocking puzzle into a
resource-matching puzzle: you might have access to an action space, but unless
you have the right worker types, you cannot use it. The design insight is that
differentiating workers by type rather than treating them as generic units
creates a second layer of constraint that makes each placement decision richer
without adding new mechanical systems.

PALADIN CARDS AS ROUND-SPECIFIC ABILITIES: Each round begins with drawing three
paladins from a personal draw pile, choosing one for the current round, placing
one on top of the pile (seen next round), and one on the bottom. The chosen
paladin provides 2 specific-color workers, temporary attribute boosts, and a
unique ability for the round. Because one unchosen paladin is placed on top of
the draw pile and will appear next round, the paladin selection involves
short-term sequencing — choosing which capability to deploy now versus
guaranteeing access to it next round. The design pattern is that round-specific
ability cards with partial information about future draws create strategic arc
planning — players must sequence their capabilities across the game's temporal
structure, not just optimize within a single round.

SUSPICION AS MORAL ECONOMY: Players accumulate Suspicion Cards whenever they
gain Criminals (via the Conspire action) or through certain other choices.
Suspicion Cards carry end-game penalties — each unresolved Suspicion costs
victory points. The Absolve action lets players remove Suspicion Cards by
spending workers and Silver. This creates a moral-economic trade-off: using
Criminals (purple workers that act as wilds) is operationally efficient but
generates Suspicion that must eventually be paid off or accepted as a scoring
loss. The Absolve action competes for the same workers and resources as
productive actions like Fortify and Garrison, so cleansing Suspicion has a
real opportunity cost. The design wisdom is that moral systems in games are
most interesting when they function as economic trade-offs with tangible
costs, not as binary good-evil labels.

TAVERN CARDS AS WORKER SUPPLEMENT: Each round, Tavern Cards equal to players
plus one are revealed, and each player selects one after revealing their
Paladin. Each Tavern Card provides 4 workers of specific types, supplementing
the 2 workers from the Paladin. Since one Tavern Card always remains unclaimed,
player order for Tavern selection matters — later players have fewer choices.
The Tavern represents a secondary worker acquisition channel that diversifies
each round's available workforce. The design pattern is that a shared drafting
pool for round resources creates meaningful turn-order considerations and
prevents players from perfectly predicting their workforce composition before
the round begins.

THREE ATTRIBUTE TRACKS AS COMPETING INVESTMENT TARGETS: Strength, Faith, and
Influence are tracked on each player's board and serve as prerequisites for
the main actions. Strength gates Garrison placement and Attack reach. Faith
gates Commission (Monk) placement regions. Influence gates Fortify (Wall)
placement and Absolve jar placement. Advancing one attribute necessarily
means slower progress on others because the actions that reward attribute
increases also consume workers and resources. The attributes are not direct
scoring tracks — they gate access to scoring actions — but they are distinct
enough that players can meaningfully specialize. The design insight is that
prerequisite attributes create strategic diversity only when they share
constrained inputs. If each attribute used entirely different resources, they
would be parallel games rather than competing investment targets.

DEBT AS DELAYED PENALTY: Players can take on debt to gain immediate resources,
accepting negative end-game scoring in exchange for short-term liquidity. Debt
functions mechanically like a loan that is never repaid — it sits on your player
board as a permanent VP drain. The availability of debt prevents resource
scarcity from creating dead turns (a player who is completely broke can still
act by taking debt), but its end-game cost ensures that debt-fueled play is a
strategy of last resort rather than an optimal path. The design pattern is that
delayed penalties for immediate gains keep the game flowing while maintaining
long-term strategic consequences — they prevent both stalling and recklessness.

KING'S ORDERS AS PUBLIC OBJECTIVES: King's Orders are revealed at the start of
specific rounds and set public scoring conditions for all players (e.g., build
5 Walls for 4 VP). The first order scores 4 VP, the second 6 VP, and the third
8 VP for every player who meets the condition by game end. Because they are
public and automatic, King's Orders create shared strategic pressure —
all players can see which goals are worth pursuing, and the scoring is generous
enough (up to 18 VP total across three orders) to influence strategic direction
without mandating it. The design wisdom is that public directed objectives
create a common strategic landscape that gives shape to otherwise open-ended
optimization.

OUTSIDER CARDS AS CONFRONTATION TARGETS: Outsiders are not workers but enemy
cards on the Main Board that players confront via the Attack action. Each
Outsider Card shows a Strength requirement and immediate rewards (workers,
resources, Influence). Players can pay Silver to compensate for insufficient
Strength. Defeated Outsiders are kept facedown as trophies. Meanwhile,
Criminals (purple workers) act as wilds on any action space but generate
Suspicion. The six standard worker types — Labourers, Scouts, Merchants,
Fighters, Clerics, and Criminals — create a multi-tier resource system where
Criminals are the most flexible but carry the heaviest penalty. The design
pattern is that resource tiers with overlapping functionality but different
side effects create decision richness at the point of acquisition rather than
the point of expenditure.

### What Makes It #78

Paladins of the West Kingdom reinvents worker placement by making workers
non-fungible. In most worker placement games, a worker is a worker — the
strategy lies in where you place it. In Paladins, the strategy lies in which
worker you place, because color, type, and moral cost all matter. The paladin
selection system adds a hand-management arc that prevents the game from
becoming a round-by-round optimization exercise, and the virtue-corruption axis
gives every decision an ethical dimension that is mechanically consequential
rather than merely thematic. The result is a worker placement game that feels
heavier and more strategic than its mechanisms suggest, because the combinatorial
space of worker types, paladin abilities, and track advancement creates a
decision tree that is wider and deeper than the component count implies. It is
the rare euro that makes you feel the weight of your compromises.
