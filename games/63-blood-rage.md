### Theme Integration

Blood Rage is set during Ragnarok, the apocalyptic twilight of Norse mythology
where the world is being consumed by destruction. Players control Viking clans
seeking glory in the final age -- not survival, but the most spectacular
death. This thematic premise is radical and it fundamentally shapes the game's
mechanics. In most area-control games, losing a battle is purely negative:
you lose units, position, and tempo. In Blood Rage, dying in battle can be
the optimal play. The Loki strategy cards reward players for losing combat,
turning defeat into a point-scoring engine. This thematic inversion -- glory
through destruction -- is not just flavor text. It creates a genuine
strategic pathway where the player with the weakest military position can
outscore the warlord through cunning manipulation of loss.

The three ages structure maps onto the mythological progression of Ragnarok.
In each age, one province is consumed by the apocalypse, physically removed
from the board by placing a Ragnarok token. Any figures in the destroyed
province are sent to Valhalla -- and the player who engineers the most
glorious deaths there benefits. The board literally shrinks over three ages,
compressing players into fewer territories and forcing escalating conflict.
This is Ragnarok as a game mechanic: the world is ending, space is
contracting, and the only question is how much glory you seize before the
lights go out. The escalation is both thematic and structural -- bigger
monsters, more powerful cards, and fewer places to stand.

The miniatures themselves serve a mechanical purpose beyond aesthetics.
Each clan has identical warrior sculpts but distinct monster miniatures tied
to specific upgrade cards. When you draft a monster card, the corresponding
miniature becomes available to you. The physicality of placing a massive
sea serpent or fire giant on the board communicates strategic information --
opponents can see your military investment -- and creates memorable moments
of spectacle. CMON's investment in miniature quality is not purely cosmetic;
it makes the game state legible and dramatic in a way that cardboard tokens
cannot replicate.

### Core Loop

The game plays over exactly 3 ages (rounds), each following this structure:

1. GODS' GIFTS (Card Drafting) - Each player receives a hand of 8 cards
   (6 at 2 players). Players simultaneously select one card to keep and
   pass the remainder to the left. Repeat until each player has drafted
   their full hand. Cards include: battle cards (combat strength modifiers),
   upgrade cards (clan improvements, monsters, warriors), and quest cards
   (secret endgame objectives). The draft IS your strategy for the age.
2. ACTION PHASE - Players take turns clockwise, performing one action each
   until all players have passed. Actions cost Rage (the game's action
   currency, starting at 6 and upgradeable). Actions include:
   - INVADE (place a figure from reserve onto an outer province or Yggdrasil)
   - MARCH (move all figures from one province to an adjacent one)
   - UPGRADE (play an upgrade card, permanently improving your clan)
   - QUEST (commit a quest card for endgame scoring if conditions are met)
   - PILLAGE (initiate combat in a province you occupy)
   When a player's Rage reaches 0, they must pass for the remainder.
3. DISCARD - Unused cards from hand are discarded. Quest cards already
   committed remain.
4. RAGNAROK - The designated province is destroyed. All figures there are
   sent to Valhalla (killed). Glory may be gained from Valhalla-related
   card effects.
5. RELEASE VALHALLA - All figures in Valhalla return to their owners'
   reserves, available for the next age.

Scoring occurs during pillaging (area majority), quest completion (endgame),
and Valhalla effects (death-based). Game ends after Age 3; highest glory wins.

### Key Design Patterns

DRAFT AS STRATEGY DEFINITION: Blood Rage's card draft is not a supplementary
system -- it IS the game's strategic layer. Every upgrade, combat trick,
quest objective, and monster deployment originates in the draft. Before a
single figure moves on the board, your strategy has been shaped by the 6-8
cards you selected. This collapses the gap between planning and execution:
you draft a Loki-focused hand, then execute a loss-based strategy. You
draft monster upgrades, then invade with overwhelming force. The draft also
creates perfect information within each age -- you know exactly which cards
you passed and can infer what opponents took. Counter-drafting (taking cards
to deny them to opponents) is as important as building your own hand. The
design principle: when the draft is the primary decision point, the action
phase becomes execution rather than exploration, and the game rewards
planning over improvisation.

LOKI STRATEGY (GLORY IN DEFEAT): Certain cards in the Loki suit reward
players for losing battles -- gaining glory when your figures are sent to
Valhalla, scoring when your figures die in Ragnarok, or triggering effects
when retreating from combat. This creates a legitimate strategic archetype
where the "weakest" player at the table can win. The Loki strategy inverts
every assumption of area-control games: you want to be in contested
provinces, you want to lose fights, you want your warriors destroyed. This
is Eric Lang's most celebrated design innovation in Blood Rage, and it
demonstrates a powerful pattern: giving players a way to score from the
negative outcome of a core interaction (combat) fundamentally opens up the
strategy space. It also makes the game more interesting for players who
dislike direct confrontation -- they can lean into loss as an identity
rather than suffering it as a setback.

RAGNAROK AS MAP COMPRESSION: One province is destroyed at the end of each
age, permanently removing it from the board. Any figures there are killed.
With 8 outer provinces at the start and 5 remaining by Age 3, the play area
physically contracts by over a third. This compression is the game's
escalation engine: fewer provinces means more competition for remaining
territory, more forced conflicts, and higher stakes per pillage action. The
Ragnarok destruction also creates a tactical opportunity -- players can
deliberately position figures in the doomed province to trigger death-based
scoring effects. The design insight: a shrinking board is a more elegant
escalation mechanism than inflating point values or adding rules complexity.
The same actions become more valuable simply because space becomes scarce.

THREE AGES AS ESCALATION STRUCTURE: Each age introduces stronger cards than
the last. Age 1 monsters are formidable; Age 3 monsters are devastating.
Battle cards escalate from modest combat modifiers to game-swinging effects.
Upgrade permanence means your clan accumulates power across ages, but your
opponents do too. The three-age structure creates a natural dramatic arc:
Age 1 is positioning and investment, Age 2 is competition and conflict,
Age 3 is climactic decisive battles. Because the card pool is separated by
age (you only draft Age 1 cards in Age 1), the escalation is guaranteed --
no player can access late-game power early. The pattern teaches that
segregating power levels by temporal phase creates reliable dramatic pacing
without requiring complex trigger conditions.

QUEST CARDS AS HIDDEN OBJECTIVES: Quest cards are committed during the
action phase but scored only at end of game if their conditions are met
(e.g., control specific provinces, have certain upgrade types, reach
specific stat thresholds). Quests create hidden incentives that other
players can partially read -- if you see someone committing a quest, you
know they have a secret objective, even if you don't know the specifics.
This informational asymmetry adds a layer of inference and deduction to
the otherwise highly visible area-control game. Quests also serve as a
catch-up mechanism: a player losing the board war might be accumulating
quest-based points that overtake the territorial leader. The design
function is dual -- quests create hidden scoring variance and they
motivate players to pursue diverse strategic paths beyond pure military
dominance.

RAGE AS ACTION ECONOMY: Rage is Blood Rage's action currency. Every action
costs Rage (typically 1 per figure involved), and when your Rage reaches
zero, you pass for the rest of the age. Starting Rage is 6, upgradeable
to 12 via the Rage track. Crucially, losing a battle refunds NO Rage --
the investment in that failed pillage is gone. This makes Rage management
the game's hidden efficiency puzzle: you need enough Rage to execute your
drafted strategy, but every wasted point is a lost action. The Rage system
also creates an asymmetric tempo -- a player who upgrades Rage early gets
more actions per age but may have invested draft picks in stat upgrades
rather than scoring cards. The design pattern: a depleting action currency
that does not refresh within a round creates natural turn-count scarcity,
forcing players to prioritize ruthlessly.

CLAN STAT TRACKS: Three upgradeable stats -- Rage (actions per age), Axes
(glory from winning battles), and Horns (maximum figures on the board) --
define your clan's capabilities. Each stat starts at a base level and
increases through upgrade cards. The stat tracks create a three-axis
specialization space: do you invest in more actions (Rage), more points
per victory (Axes), or more board presence (Horns)? Because upgrade cards
are drafted, your stat development is constrained by what appears in your
draft pool. The interplay between stats creates emergent archetypes: high
Rage + low Horns is an efficiency build; high Horns + high Axes is a
domination build; low everything with Loki cards is a death-glory build.
The pattern: small numbers of upgradeable parameters, when combined with
restricted access (drafting), create diverse strategic identities from
minimal mechanical complexity.

PILLAGE AS CONTROLLED COMBAT: Combat only occurs when a player initiates
a Pillage action in a province they occupy. The pillaging player chooses
when and where to fight, giving the aggressor initiative. All players with
figures in the province participate, simultaneously playing one card from
hand (or nothing). Total strength = figures' strength + card value.
Highest total wins; losers' figures go to Valhalla. The winner gains
glory equal to the pillaged province's reward plus their Axes stat bonus.
Each province can only be successfully pillaged once per age (it flips to
indicate completion). This system gives combat a clear economic structure:
every battle has a known reward value, and the decision is whether that
reward justifies the Rage cost, the card expenditure, and the risk of
losing figures.

### What Makes It #63

Blood Rage distills the area-control genre to its essence and then subverts
it with the Loki strategy. The card draft collapses strategic planning into
a single intense decision phase. Ragnarok's map compression guarantees
escalating conflict without artificial point inflation. The three-stat
upgrade system creates diverse clan identities from minimal parameters.
And the glory-in-death mechanic transforms every combat encounter from a
binary win/lose into a multi-dimensional calculation where losing might
be the best outcome. Blood Rage proves that a medium-weight game can
contain genuine strategic depth when every system -- drafting, combat,
spatial control, hidden objectives -- reinforces a single thematic vision
of glorious apocalypse.
