## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Anachrony is set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has fractured
into four ideological Paths, each preparing for an impending asteroid impact
that will reshape civilization. The science fiction premise is not wallpaper --
the time travel mechanic is the game's signature system, and every thematic
element maps onto a concrete mechanical function. Players lead their Path
through the final eras before the Cataclysm, borrowing resources from their
own future through temporal rifts. The asteroid impact is not a distant
abstraction; it arrives mid-game, physically transforming the main board and
altering available action spaces. The narrative arc -- preparation, impact,
evacuation -- structures the entire mechanical progression.

The four Paths (Dominance, Progress, Salvation, Harmony) are not merely
cosmetic factions. Each has a unique leader with an asymmetric ability, a
unique set of buildings that modify action spaces, and a distinct strategic
personality. Dominance excels at military output and worker efficiency;
Progress leverages scientific advancement and breakthrough technologies;
Salvation focuses on morale and civilian welfare; Harmony emphasizes
resource sustainability and balanced development. The faction design
communicates worldview through mechanics: how you rebuild civilization
depends on what you value, and the game makes each value system
mechanically viable. This is thematic asymmetry at its most committed --
the factions don't just play differently, they philosophically disagree
about what matters.

The exosuit system deepens the thematic texture. Workers cannot access the
main board's action spaces without exosuits -- powered armor that represents
the hostile state of the post-apocalyptic world. Exosuits are limited,
must be powered each era, and can be damaged or lost. This constraint
transforms worker placement from an abstract "place token, take action"
into a logistical puzzle: you need the right worker type, an available
exosuit, and sufficient power to deploy. The world is dangerous, resources
are scarce, and sending people out requires infrastructure. The exosuit
layer adds friction that feels thematically justified rather than
mechanically arbitrary.

### Core Loop

The game spans 4-7 eras (rounds), with the Cataclysm occurring after
era 4 and the game ending after era 7 or earlier if triggered. Each era
follows this sequence:

1. PREPARATION PHASE - Reveal the next Superproject above the timeline.
   Shift building offers. Draw a Recruit pool card and a Mine pool card to
   determine available workers and resources for the era.
2. PARADOX PHASE - For each timeline tile with outstanding warp tiles,
   the player(s) with the most warp tiles on it roll the Paradox die,
   potentially gaining Paradox tokens. Three Paradoxes trigger an Anomaly
   (a -3 VP tile placed on your player board). Skipped in era 1.
3. POWER UP PHASE - Each player places up to 6 exosuits on their hex
   slots, paying 1 Energy Core for each on the bottom three slots.
   Remaining empty hex slots generate 1 Water each.
4. WARP PHASE - Request assets from your future self via the time rift.
   Secretly select 0-2 warp tiles and place them on the current timeline
   tile. Warp tile types include resources, workers, water, or a powered-up
   exosuit. Receive the assets immediately. You must repay these debts in
   future eras by sending matching assets back -- or suffer paradoxes.
5. ACTION ROUNDS - Players alternate placing one exosuited worker on the
   main board or one bare worker on their own player board. Main board
   actions include: Construct buildings, Recruit workers, Research
   breakthroughs (Capital Actions), plus Mine resources, Purify Water,
   Trade with Nomads, and the World Council. Player board actions include
   Supply, Force Workers, and faction-specific building actions.
   Continue until all players pass.
6. CLEAN-UP PHASE - Retrieve workers and exosuits. Check for Impact
   (after era 4, the asteroid strikes: Capital Action hex spaces gain
   Collapsing Capital tiles, evacuation opens, and two exosuit slots per
   player become unavailable). Check for game end. Advance era marker.

### Key Design Patterns

TIME TRAVEL AS RESOURCE LOAN: Anachrony's signature innovation is its warp
mechanic, which allows players to borrow resources from their own future.
During the Warp Phase, you place a warp tile on your timeline specifying a
resource type. You receive that resource immediately, but the tile creates
a debt: in a future era, you must send matching resources back in time to
"close the loop." If you repay the debt, the warp tile is removed and you
gain bonus VP. If you fail to repay, you suffer an anomaly (negative VP and
potential paradox effects). The design brilliance is that this mechanic is
simultaneously a loan system, a planning puzzle, and a narrative device.
Borrowing from the future lets you accelerate your development at the cost
of future obligation -- but the obligation is flexible, because you choose
when to repay within the game's timeline. The mechanic teaches a reusable
design principle: temporal mechanics can be abstracted as debt instruments,
making time travel accessible without paradox-logic headaches.

EXOSUIT GATING: Workers cannot access the main board without exosuits, and
exosuits are a limited resource that must be powered and maintained each era.
This creates a bottleneck between your worker pool and your action potential.
You might have five workers but only three exosuits, forcing you to choose
which capital actions matter most. Exosuits can also be damaged, further
constraining access. The design function is layered scarcity: worker
placement games typically limit players by the number of workers or the
number of action spaces. Anachrony adds a third constraint -- the vehicle
that connects workers to spaces. This makes deployment decisions more
granular and strategic. The lesson for designers: adding a mediating
resource between workers and actions creates richer decision spaces
without adding proportionally more rules.

FACTION ASYMMETRY THROUGH BUILDINGS: Each Path has unique buildings that
modify their personal action spaces. When you construct a faction-specific
building, it upgrades one of your player board actions -- your Path's
research lab might give extra breakthroughs, while another Path's barracks
might produce stronger workers. This means asymmetry is not just a starting
condition but an evolving differentiation. As players build their
faction-specific structures, their capabilities diverge further from each
other. Two players who start the game with similar positions will play
increasingly different games as their buildings come online. The pattern
here is progressive asymmetry: starting differences are small and grow
larger through player investment, which avoids the cognitive overload of
learning a fully unique faction ruleset in the first era.

THE CATACLYSM AS MID-GAME STATE CHANGE: After era 4, the asteroid impacts.
The main board physically changes: certain action spaces close, new
evacuation-focused actions open, and the strategic priorities shift from
development to survival and scoring. This is not a soft narrative beat --
it mechanically transforms the game. Players who over-invested in capital
infrastructure suddenly find those actions unavailable. Players who prepared
for the impact (stockpiling resources, developing evacuation capacity) are
rewarded. The Cataclysm divides the game into two distinct strategic phases:
build-up and wind-down. The design principle is structural pivot: a
predetermined event that forces all players to adapt their strategies
simultaneously, preventing any single approach from dominating the entire
game arc.

EVACUATION AS ENDGAME PIVOT: After the Cataclysm, players can evacuate
their population by sending workers and resources to the World Capital.
Evacuation is a major source of endgame VP but requires specific resources
and planning. Players must balance between continuing to score through
normal actions and investing in evacuation logistics. The evacuation system
creates a natural endgame compression: resources that were previously
invested in development must now be redirected toward scoring. This prevents
the common euro-game problem of late-game autopilot, where players simply
repeat their established engine. Post-Cataclysm Anachrony demands genuine
strategic recalibration.

TEMPORAL PARADOX AS PENALTY SYSTEM: When a player fails to repay a time
travel debt, they receive an anomaly tile -- a permanent negative VP marker
that also clutters their timeline, reducing future warp capacity. If enough
anomalies accumulate, the player suffers compounding penalties. The paradox
system is the time travel mechanic's enforcement arm: it makes borrowing
from the future genuinely risky without making it catastrophic. A single
anomaly is manageable; multiple anomalies become crippling. This graduated
penalty curve encourages calculated risk-taking rather than either reckless
borrowing or total avoidance. The design wisdom: penalty systems should
scale nonlinearly -- mild for the first offense, severe for repeated
violations -- to create a meaningful risk-reward spectrum.

WORKER TYPES AS SPECIALIZATION: Anachrony features multiple worker types
(engineers, scientists, administrators, geniuses) rather than generic
workers. Certain action spaces require specific worker types, and geniuses
function as wildcards. Worker recruitment from a shared pool (determined
each era by recruit pool cards) adds controlled randomness to workforce
composition. The constraint
of matching worker types to action requirements creates an additional
planning layer: you need not just enough workers, but the right workers.
This pattern adds roster-management depth to the worker-placement
framework and rewards players who diversify their workforce while
maintaining flexibility through genius workers.

BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGY: Research breakthroughs are powerful one-time or
ongoing effects that represent technological advances. They serve as the
game's tech-tree equivalent, offering asymmetric upgrades that can
dramatically alter a player's capabilities. Breakthroughs are acquired
through specific actions and warp requests, and their availability varies
by game. The breakthrough system creates meaningful strategic pivots:
a well-timed breakthrough can unlock an entirely new scoring pathway or
solve a critical resource bottleneck. Because breakthroughs are limited
and competitive, they also serve as a subtle interaction mechanism --
claiming a breakthrough denies it to opponents.

### What Makes It #62

Anachrony's time travel loan mechanic is its singular contribution to the
worker-placement genre. No other game makes temporal mechanics feel this
intuitive and strategically meaningful. The warp system transforms abstract
resource management into a narrative about consequence and obligation --
you can have anything you need right now, but your future self will pay
the price. Layered onto this is the Cataclysm's structural pivot, the
exosuit deployment puzzle, and the progressive faction asymmetry. The
result is a game that uses its science fiction premise not as decoration
but as the engine of its most important design decisions. Anachrony proves
that thematic mechanics and strategic depth are not in tension -- they
are the same thing.
