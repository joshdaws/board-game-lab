## Design Notes

Designer: Reiner Stockhausen. Published by dlp Games / Tasty Minstrel Games (2014).

### Theme Integration

Medieval France, centered on the city of Orleans, provides the setting for a game
about building a merchant enterprise through recruiting followers, traveling trade
routes, and establishing a commercial network. The theme is more functional than
immersive — Orleans belongs to the Euro tradition where mechanisms carry the
experience and the setting provides legible metaphors rather than narrative weight.
That said, the follower types map convincingly onto a medieval social structure:
Farmers work the land, Boatmen navigate rivers, Craftsmen build, Traders generate
wealth, Knights provide protection for travel, Scholars advance civic development,
and Monks serve as flexible wildcards reflecting the church's pervasive role in
medieval society. The map of central France with its roads and waterways radiating
outward from Orleans gives spatial grounding to what is fundamentally an
engine-building game. Trading posts placed along routes evoke the Hanseatic League
model of mercantile expansion through physical presence. The Beneficial Deeds
track — where followers are permanently donated for civic virtue — translates the
medieval concept of patronage and piety into a mechanical tension between personal
engine efficiency and public scoring. The event cards that affect all players each
round gesture toward the unpredictability of medieval life: plagues, taxes, pilgrimages,
and harvests that no individual merchant can control.

### Core Loop

The game is played over 18 rounds. Each round follows a fixed sequence:

1. EVENT PHASE - Reveal the next event card from a shuffled stack of hour-glass
   tiles. The event takes effect at the end of the round (after actions), creating
   advance knowledge of a shared threat or opportunity. Events include taxation
   (lose coins), plague (lose followers), pilgrimage (bonus for monks), and harvest
   (gain goods). Players can see what's coming and plan their round accordingly.
2. CENSUS PHASE - Determine first player for the round based on who is farthest
   along the census track (a proxy for agricultural capacity, advanced by Farmers).
   Ties broken by current player order.
3. DRAW PHASE - Each player simultaneously draws follower tokens from their personal
   bag. The number drawn equals their current draw count (starting at 4, potentially
   increased to 5-8 through technology tiles). This is the game's signature moment:
   you reach into the bag blind, and what you pull determines your options.
4. PLANNING PHASE - Simultaneously, each player places their drawn followers onto
   action spaces on their personal player board. Each action space requires a specific
   combination of follower types. Unplaceable followers sit idle for the round.
5. ACTION PHASE - In player order, each player resolves their activated action spaces
   one at a time. Actions include: Village (recruit a new follower), Ship (travel by
   waterway), Wagon (travel by road), Guildhall (gain a technology tile), Castle
   (gain coins), Scriptorium (gain Development track progress), Farmhouse (advance
   census and gain a good), Town Hall (place a follower on Beneficial Deeds for VP).
6. EVENT RESOLUTION - The revealed event now takes effect, potentially costing
   resources or granting bonuses.

Game ends after round 18. Final scoring: coins, goods sets, trading stations,
citizen tiles, Beneficial Deeds VP, and Development track bonuses.

### Key Design Patterns

BAG-BUILDING AS DECK-BUILDING'S PHYSICAL COUSIN: Orleans's defining contribution
to modern game design is the bag-building mechanism — a tactile reinterpretation of
deck-building that replaces cards with tokens drawn from a cloth bag. The shift from
deck to bag is not merely cosmetic; it changes the psychology and probability texture
of the engine-building experience. A deck cycles predictably — you will eventually
see every card — while a bag draw is sampling with replacement within a round but
without replacement across a round's draws. The physical act of reaching into a bag
and drawing blind creates a qualitatively different experience from drawing cards off
a pile. There is no discard pile to count, no ability to calculate exact odds of
what's next. The opacity of the bag forces players to think in probabilities rather
than certainties, and to build engines robust enough to function across a range of
draws rather than dependent on precise sequences. This is Stockhausen's central
insight: by making the randomness more opaque but the strategic layer more forgiving
(because most follower combinations do something useful), the game generates tension
from the draw without generating frustration.

ADDITION VS. SUBTRACTION — THE BAG MANAGEMENT DIALECTIC: The deepest strategic
tension in Orleans is the relationship between adding followers to your bag and
removing them. Recruiting new followers expands your capabilities — you need Boatmen
to travel by water, Traders to earn income, Scholars to advance development. But
every addition dilutes your bag. If you have 12 followers and draw 4, any specific
follower appears with roughly 1-in-3 probability. Add 6 more followers without
removing any, and that probability drops to roughly 1-in-4.5. The Beneficial Deeds
track and the Town Hall action provide the counterweight: you can permanently remove
followers from your bag, thinning it for more consistent draws while simultaneously
scoring victory points. This mirrors the deck-thinning principle from Dominion but
with a crucial difference — removed followers are placed on a public board where they
score points based on quantity and type, making thinning a scoring strategy rather
than merely an optimization technique. The best Orleans players treat their bag as
a living system, carefully balancing the rate of recruitment against the rate of
donation to maintain a lean, purposeful engine.

SIMULTANEOUS PLANNING WITH SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION: The draw and planning phases are
simultaneous, eliminating downtime during the game's most cognitively demanding
moments. Everyone draws, everyone places, and the table hums with parallel
decision-making. But action resolution is sequential in player order, which matters
for competitive elements — claiming trading post bonuses, taking limited technology
tiles, or reaching map locations first. This hybrid structure gives Orleans the
pacing benefits of simultaneous play without sacrificing the interactive tension of
turn order. The census mechanism for determining player order adds another layer:
investing in Farmers (who are otherwise modest followers) earns first-player
priority, which can be decisive when multiple players compete for the same map
positions or technology tiles.

TECHNOLOGY TILES AS PERMANENT MODIFIERS: The Guildhall action grants technology
tiles that permanently modify your capabilities — extra draws from the bag, bonus
actions, resource conversions, or rule-breaking abilities. These tiles function as
the "card market" equivalent in a deck-builder: they're the primary way to customize
your engine beyond raw follower composition. Because technology tiles are drawn from
a limited supply and provide unique, powerful effects, the Guildhall becomes a
contested action space. Early technology acquisition can define a player's entire
strategic arc, creating divergent play experiences even when players start from
identical positions. The tiles also serve as a catch-up mechanism — powerful tiles
remain available even as the game progresses, and a well-timed technology grab can
compensate for a slow start.

SPATIAL NETWORK AS SCORING MULTIPLIER: The map of France is not merely decorative.
Traveling by road (Wagon) or river (Ship) allows players to place trading posts at
locations, and having a trading post at a location unlocks its resource bonus
whenever you pass through. The most-posts-at-a-location majority grants additional
end-game scoring. This spatial layer transforms Orleans from a pure engine puzzle into
a game with territorial competition. Route planning matters: players must choose
whether to expand broadly for coverage or concentrate on lucrative corridors. The
spatial element also creates indirect interaction — when you see an opponent heading
toward a location, you must decide whether to race them there or concede that area
and invest your followers elsewhere. The goods collected from map locations form sets
that score escalating VP, connecting the spatial game to the collection game.

CITIZEN TILES AND THE DEVELOPMENT TRACK: The Scriptorium action advances a player
on the Development track, which grants citizen tiles at specific thresholds. Citizen
tiles provide powerful permanent abilities — they are effectively the game's path to
specialization. A player pursuing a development-heavy strategy may accumulate citizens
that fundamentally alter how their engine operates, while a player ignoring
development relies on raw bag efficiency and map presence. The Development track also
gates access to increasingly valuable citizens, creating an incentive to invest early
and consistently rather than dipping in occasionally. This track represents the
"tall vs. wide" strategic spectrum present in many engine-building games: you can
build a narrow, deep engine through development, or a broad, flexible one through
follower recruitment and map expansion.

EVENT CARDS AS SHARED VOLATILITY: The event system introduces communal uncertainty
that affects all players equally. Because the event is revealed at the start of each
round but resolves at the end, players have one full round to prepare — hoarding
coins against taxation, ensuring they have monks for a pilgrimage, or holding
followers in reserve against plague. This creates a planning horizon that interacts
with the bag-building core: sometimes the "correct" action for your engine is
overridden by the need to prepare for an event. Events also serve as a pacing
mechanism, periodically stripping resources from all players and preventing runaway
engines from becoming completely dominant. The foreknowledge — seeing the event
before planning — is a deliberate design choice that rewards adaptation over
reaction, keeping the game strategic rather than punitive.

PARALLEL VICTORY PATHS WITHOUT POINT SALAD: Orleans offers multiple scoring avenues
— goods sets, trading post networks, Beneficial Deeds, citizen tiles, coins, and
Development track bonuses — but calling it a "point salad" undersells the structural
coherence. Each scoring path requires different follower types and different action
investments, meaning a player who pursues goods must invest in travel and Farmers,
while a player pursuing Beneficial Deeds must recruit broadly and then donate
strategically. The paths are genuinely parallel rather than additive: focusing on one
typically means deprioritizing another. This creates strategic diversity across games
without requiring asymmetric player powers. The winner is usually the player who
identifies which path is least contested and most compatible with their early draws,
then commits to it while maintaining just enough flexibility to pivot if the bag
demands it.

### What Makes It #36

Orleans occupies a distinctive position in the modern Euro canon as the game that
proved bag-building could sustain a full-weight strategy game. Before Orleans, bag
mechanisms existed as components within larger systems. Stockhausen demonstrated that
the cloth bag could replace the card deck as a complete engine-building foundation,
spawning an entire subgenre (Altiplano, Quacks of Quedlinburg, War Chest). The
design's enduring appeal rests on three pillars. First, the tactile pleasure of the
draw — reaching into a bag and pulling tokens is inherently more engaging than
flipping cards, and the physical opacity creates genuine suspense. Second, the
add-versus-subtract tension gives the game a strategic depth that rewards long-term
planning: every recruit is an investment that dilutes your engine, and every donation
is a sacrifice that refines it, forcing constant evaluation of your bag's composition.
Third, the parallel victory paths combined with simultaneous planning create a game
that scales well from 2 to 4 players without dramatic downtime increases. Orleans
does not attempt to be a thematic narrative or a confrontational wargame — it is a
pure engine-optimization puzzle wrapped in an accessible medieval trading theme, and
it executes that vision with uncommon elegance. The 3.01 weight rating reflects a
game that is conceptually rich but procedurally clean: the rules are simple, the
decisions are deep, and the bag is always waiting to be drawn.
