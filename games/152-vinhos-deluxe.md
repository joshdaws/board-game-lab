## Design Notes

Designer: Vital Lacerda. Published by Eagle-Gryphon Games (2016).

### Theme Integration

Vinhos is Vital Lacerda's love letter to the Portuguese wine industry, and
it may be his most thematically integrated design. Players are Portuguese
wine magnates acquiring estates across the country's six major wine
regions — Vinho Verde, Douro, Dão, Bairrada, Alentejo, and the Lisbon
corridor. Each region produces wine of distinct character, and the game's
mechanical systems model the actual process of winemaking with striking
fidelity. Buying an estate gives you land; hiring an enologist improves
grape quality; building a cellar enables aging; and connecting with wine
merchants or exporters creates pathways to market. The thematic logic is
so consistent that players can often intuit the rules — of course aged
wine scores better at exhibitions, of course hiring a better enologist
improves your vintage, of course the bank charges interest on loans.

The Deluxe Edition offers two rulesets — the 2010 Reserve vintage (the
original, heavier design) and the streamlined 2016 edition — reflecting
Lacerda's own evolution as a designer. Both versions revolve around the
same core economic cycle: acquire estates, improve wine quality through
investment, and convert wine into prestige through exhibitions and
exports. The dual-ruleset approach is itself a design statement,
acknowledging that the same thematic system can support different
complexity levels without losing its essential character. The 2016
rules simplify the action selection mechanism and scoring, while the
Reserve rules preserve the original's punishing economic constraints.

Portugal's wine culture permeates the game's visual and structural
identity. The map centers on Portugal, not a generic abstracted board.
Wine quality is tracked through vintages that improve with cellar
investment. The exhibition system, where players compete to showcase
their best wines before expert judges, mirrors the real-world feira
do vinho tradition. Even the banking system carries thematic weight —
players who overextend financially face interest penalties that erode
their carefully built margins, just as real wine businesses suffer
when they invest beyond their means in a product that requires years
to mature.

### Core Loop

The game plays over six years (rounds), with wine exhibitions occurring
at the end of years two, four, and six. Each year, players take turns
performing actions on a shared action display.

**ACTION SELECTION**

The central board features a grid of action spaces arranged in rows and
columns. On your turn, you move your action marker to a new space on the
grid, executing the action at the intersection. Moving within the same
row or column is free; moving to a different row AND column costs one
money. This movement cost creates a spatial planning puzzle layered atop
the action selection — sequential actions that stay along one axis are
cheaper than zigzagging across the board.

Core actions include:

1. BUY ESTATE — Acquire a vineyard in one of six wine regions. Each
   estate produces wine of a base quality determined by the region and
   your investments. Multiple estates in one region increase your area
   influence.

2. HIRE ENOLOGIST — Place or upgrade a winemaker on one of your estates,
   improving the wine quality produced there. Better enologists cost more
   but create significant quality improvements.

3. BUILD CELLAR — Construct aging facilities on an estate. Cellars allow
   wine to age between vintages, increasing its quality for exhibitions.
   More advanced cellars provide greater aging benefits.

4. SELL WINE — Export wine through merchants or direct sales channels.
   Different sales paths offer different reward structures — some provide
   immediate money, others provide victory points, and some grant
   influence with specific regions.

5. BANK — Manage finances by depositing money (earning interest), taking
   loans (paying interest), or accessing special financial actions. The
   banking system rewards fiscal planning and punishes overextension.

6. HIRE EXPERTS — Recruit specialists who provide ongoing bonuses to
   specific aspects of your wine operation — production, aging, sales,
   or exhibition performance.

**EXHIBITION PHASE (Years 2, 4, and 6)**

After the action rounds of years two, four, and six, all players
participate in a wine exhibition. Each player selects one wine from
their estates to present. Wine quality is determined by the estate's
base value, enologist bonus, and cellar aging. Players then compete
for exhibition rankings, with higher-quality wines earning more
prestige points. The exhibition also awards bonuses for regional
diversity and consistency.

1. Select a wine from your available estates.
2. Calculate final wine quality (base + enologist + aging bonuses).
3. Compare quality against other players' entries.
4. Award prestige points based on relative ranking.
5. Apply regional bonuses and expert modifiers.

**YEAR END**

Maintain estates, pay any loan interest, age wines in cellars, and
advance the year marker. After the sixth year's exhibition, conduct
final scoring including area majority bonuses in each region, export
achievements, and remaining wealth.

### Key Design Patterns

ACTION GRID MOVEMENT COST: The action selection grid — where moving
along one axis is free but crossing to a different row and column costs
money — is Vinhos' signature mechanism and one of Lacerda's most
elegant inventions. It creates a planning horizon that extends beyond
the current turn: you want to sequence your actions so that consecutive
turns share a row or column, minimizing movement costs. This transforms
the decision from "which action is best right now" to "which sequence
of actions across multiple turns is most efficient." The grid also
creates implicit interaction — when opponents occupy spaces along your
preferred axis, you must either wait, pay to reroute, or settle for a
suboptimal action. The spatial constraint converts a simple action
selection system into a multi-turn optimization puzzle with emergent
blocking.

QUALITY AS LAYERED INVESTMENT: Wine quality in Vinhos is not a single
attribute but a composite of multiple independent investments — estate
location, enologist skill, cellar infrastructure, and aging time. Each
layer provides diminishing returns on its own but compounds powerfully
with others. An excellent enologist paired with a basic estate and no
cellar produces decent wine; the same enologist with a premium estate
and advanced cellar produces exceptional wine. This layered quality
system rewards holistic planning over single-dimension optimization.
It also creates meaningful strategic diversity: one player might pursue
few estates with deep investment in each, while another spreads across
many regions with moderate quality everywhere.

EXHIBITION AS COMPETITIVE CHECKPOINT: The three exhibitions at years
two, four, and six serve as competitive benchmarks that structure the
game's pacing. They are not optional — every player must present a
wine, meaning production readiness is a mandatory consideration, not
a choice. The exhibitions convert the game's private optimization
(building your wine portfolio) into a public contest with relative
scoring. A wine that would be excellent in year two might be mediocre
by year six as other players improve their estates. The checkpoint
structure forces players to have something worth showing at regular
intervals, preventing pure engine-building strategies that defer all
scoring until the end.

AREA MAJORITY AS SECONDARY SYSTEM: Regional influence, tracked by how
many estates and investments a player has in each wine region, creates
end-game majority bonuses. This secondary scoring layer interacts with
the primary wine quality system — investing deeply in one region for
area majority also concentrates your wine production, while spreading
across regions diversifies your portfolio but dilutes your influence.
The area majority system adds a spatial competition layer to what would
otherwise be a purely personal optimization puzzle, ensuring that
players must account for opponents' regional strategies.

FINANCIAL DISCIPLINE AS DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: Lacerda's banking system
is not an afterthought — it is the game's governor. Loans are available
but carry recurring interest costs that compound over the game's six
years. Deposits earn interest, rewarding cash reserves. Every action
has a monetary cost, and running out of money forces suboptimal
decisions. The financial system teaches a design lesson: in a game
about long-term investment (wine takes years to mature), the
economic model must reward patience and punish overextension. Players
who invest beyond their means score fewer points than those who grow
sustainably, even if their wines are theoretically superior.

DUAL RULESET AS DESIGN EVOLUTION: The Deluxe Edition's inclusion of
both the original 2010 rules and the streamlined 2016 rules is itself
a design pattern worth studying. The same thematic framework supports
two different complexity levels, demonstrating that complexity is a
design variable, not a fixed property of a theme. The 2016 rules
simplify action selection and scoring without altering the game's
strategic character — the same decisions matter, but the calculation
overhead is reduced. This dual approach serves different audiences
without requiring a separate product, and it documents Lacerda's own
design maturation in a single box.

EXPERT SPECIALIZATION: Hired experts provide ongoing bonuses that
amplify specific strategies. A production expert makes estates more
efficient; an aging expert improves cellar output; a sales expert
increases export revenue. Experts create strategic lock-in — once
you invest in a production expert, you have incentive to buy more
estates to maximize that bonus. This creates divergent player
trajectories and reduces the likelihood of identical strategies at
the same table, as each player's expert portfolio nudges them toward
different optimization paths.

### What Makes It #152

Vinhos: Deluxe Edition represents Lacerda's most thematically coherent
design — every mechanism maps to a real step in winemaking, and the
economic model captures the patience-intensive, quality-obsessed nature
of the wine industry. The action grid movement system remains one of the
most inventive action selection mechanisms in the hobby, creating multi-
turn planning puzzles from a simple spatial constraint. The exhibition
checkpoints prevent the game from becoming a solitary optimization
exercise by forcing competitive comparison at regular intervals. The
Deluxe Edition's dual-ruleset offering gives players access to both
Lacerda's ambitious original vision and his refined revision, making
the box a document of design evolution. Its ranking reflects a game
that rewards deep strategic investment with a thematic payoff that
feels earned — building a great wine portfolio over six years of
careful planning delivers the same satisfaction as the real craft it
models.
