## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Andromeda's Edge places players on the frontier of a newly discovered galaxy,
where rival factions compete to establish dominance over a modular hex-based
star map. The theme is not merely cosmetic backdrop — it drives the core
structural decisions of the design. Each faction possesses unique asymmetric
powers that reflect distinct approaches to galactic colonization: some factions
excel at military conquest while others leverage economic or technological
superiority. The hex grid physically represents the contested frontier, with
each tile offering different strategic value based on its resources, position,
and adjacency to other claimed territories. Ships, stations, and outposts are
not generic tokens but functionally differentiated units that model the
logistical reality of projecting power across interstellar distances.

The dice-as-workers mechanism is the design's most thematic stroke. Dice
represent the unpredictable resources available at the edge of explored space —
you work with what the frontier gives you, not what you planned for. The tech
tree reinforces the exploration narrative: as factions push deeper into
Andromeda, they unlock capabilities that transform their strategic options.
Events inject narrative volatility, representing the chaotic nature of frontier
expansion — stellar phenomena, alien encounters, and political shifts that no
faction can fully anticipate. The combination of worker placement stability
with dice-driven variability captures the tension between careful planning and
frontier improvisation that defines the space exploration fantasy.

The area majority scoring transforms the hex map from a passive landscape into
a contested political map. Territory is not simply claimed — it must be
defended and reinforced. The interplay between building infrastructure (stations
and outposts) and projecting military force (ships) models the dual challenge
of colonization: you must develop your holdings while protecting them from
rivals. End game bonuses reward factions that achieve specific strategic
objectives, ensuring that the game's narrative arc moves from exploration
through development to final consolidation of power.

### Core Loop

The game is played over a variable number of rounds until end-game conditions
are triggered. Each round, players take turns placing dice-workers and
resolving actions until all players have passed.

**On Your Turn:**

1. ROLL AND ASSIGN DICE — At the start of each round, roll your pool of
   dice. The values determine which placement spots are available and how
   effective your actions will be. Different worker types (ship dice,
   station dice) access different action spaces.

2. PLACE A DIE OR PASS — Select one of your rolled dice and place it on
   an available action space. Action spaces exist on:
   a) The shared galactic board — hex tiles offering territory control,
      resource extraction, and combat opportunities
   b) Your faction board — personal action spaces for technology research,
      fleet building, and infrastructure development
   c) Shared market spaces — for acquiring cards, resources, or upgrades

3. RESOLVE THE ACTION — Execute the action associated with your placement:
   a) EXPLORE — Place new hex tiles to expand the map, gaining first-mover
      advantage on newly revealed territory
   b) BUILD — Construct stations or outposts on hexes you influence,
      increasing your area majority and generating ongoing benefits
   c) RESEARCH — Advance along your tech tree, unlocking new abilities,
      improved dice, or scoring multipliers
   d) RECRUIT — Add new dice to your pool or upgrade existing dice to
      more powerful worker types
   e) TRADE — Exchange resources, acquire cards from the market, or
      fulfill contracts for VP
   f) ATTACK — Initiate combat with rival units on contested hexes,
      using dice values and card play to resolve conflicts

4. CHECK EVENTS — Certain triggers cause event cards to resolve, affecting
   all players or specific board regions.

5. PASS — When you have placed all dice or choose to stop, pass for the
   round. Early passing may grant turn order advantages.

**Round End:** Collect income from controlled territories, check for end-game
triggers (map completion, score thresholds, or tech tree completion).

**End Game:** Final area majority scoring across all contested regions, plus
end game bonus cards and tech tree completion bonuses. Highest VP wins.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE AS DIFFERENTIATED WORKERS: Andromeda's Edge uses dice not as random
resolution tools but as worker placement tokens whose values constrain
placement options. High-value dice access powerful spaces; low-value dice
fit into efficient but modest slots. The different worker types (ships vs.
stations) add a second axis of differentiation — it is not just what number
you rolled but what type of die it is. This dual-axis constraint on a
fundamentally random input creates a rich decision space: you must optimize
within the constraints of your roll while planning your dice pool composition
for future rounds. The design principle is that randomness in input (what
you get) combined with determinism in output (what you do with it) creates
more interesting decisions than either pure randomness or pure determinism.

MODULAR HEX MAP AS EMERGENT GEOGRAPHY: The variable setup and map addition
mechanics ensure that no two games present the same strategic landscape.
Hex tiles are placed during the game, meaning the geography emerges from
player decisions rather than being predetermined. This transforms exploration
from a thematic wrapper into a genuine strategic mechanism — the player who
explores effectively shapes the map to favor their faction's strengths. The
hexagon grid provides six-directional adjacency, creating richer area majority
calculations than square grids and more natural territorial boundaries.

TECH TREE AS STRATEGIC COMMITMENT: The tech tree is not a menu of
interchangeable upgrades but a branching path that requires commitment.
Early tech choices constrain later options, meaning players must forecast
their strategic needs several rounds ahead. The tree interacts with the
dice system — certain technologies upgrade dice, unlock new worker types,
or modify placement rules. This creates a feedback loop where tech
investment improves your action economy, which enables further tech
investment. The design insight is that tech trees work best when they
create divergent paths rather than linear progressions, ensuring that
each player's technological trajectory feels distinct.

AREA MAJORITY WITH INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT: Unlike pure area majority
games where influence is projected through unit placement alone, Andromeda's
Edge requires infrastructure investment to secure territorial control.
Stations and outposts provide persistent influence that ships alone cannot
match. This dual-layer system — mobile units for projection, static
buildings for consolidation — prevents the "whack-a-mole" problem common
in area majority designs where players simply redirect tokens to wherever
scoring is imminent. You must commit to territories through building, which
creates meaningful strategic stakes around location selection.

EVENT-DRIVEN NARRATIVE DISRUPTION: Events serve as controlled chaos
injections that prevent the game from becoming a pure optimization
exercise. By introducing unpredictable external pressures — resource
shifts, scoring opportunities, or board-state changes — events force
players to maintain strategic flexibility rather than locking into rigid
plans. The design balances disruption against player agency: events create
new conditions to respond to, but they do not directly undo player
accomplishments. This is the critical distinction between "interesting
disruption" and "frustrating randomness."

ASYMMETRIC FACTIONS AS REPLAYABILITY ENGINE: Variable player powers ensure
that each faction approaches the same strategic landscape from a different
angle. The asymmetry is designed to interact with the variable map setup,
meaning that faction strength varies with geography. A faction strong in
military projection thrives on contested maps with clustered high-value
hexes; a technology-focused faction prefers dispersed maps where efficient
development outweighs combat. This interaction between variable powers and
variable setup creates combinatorial replayability far exceeding what
either mechanism provides alone.

ESCALATING ACTION ECONOMY: The recruit and research mechanisms allow
players to expand their dice pool and improve dice quality over the
course of the game. Early rounds feature tight, constrained decision
spaces; late rounds offer increasingly powerful turns as engines come
online. This escalation mirrors the thematic arc from tentative frontier
exploration to established galactic power. The design challenge — which
the Lauries manage through end-game triggers — is ensuring that engine
divergence does not create runaway leader problems. The area majority
scoring provides a natural catch-up mechanism: the leading player becomes
the target for territorial challenges.

### What Makes It #191

Andromeda's Edge succeeds by layering familiar mechanisms — worker placement,
area majority, tech trees — into a combination that feels genuinely novel.
The dice-as-workers concept has appeared in other designs, but the addition
of different worker types, a modular hex map, and asymmetric factions creates
interaction density that simpler dice placement games lack. The Lauries
demonstrate that mechanical innovation does not require inventing new
mechanisms from scratch; it can emerge from combining established mechanisms
in ways that create new emergent properties. The game's weight (3.74) sits
in a sweet spot for strategic gamers who want meaningful decisions without
the four-hour commitment of heavier 4X games. Its ranking reflects a design
that delivers on the promise of its ambitious mechanism blend while remaining
accessible enough to reward repeated play.
