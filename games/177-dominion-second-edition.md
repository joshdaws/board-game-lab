## Design Notes

Designer: Donald X. Vaccarino. Published by Rio Grande Games (2016).

### Theme Integration

Dominion: Second Edition retains the deliberately thin medieval kingdom
metaphor that characterized the original 2008 release. Players are monarchs
expanding their domains through card acquisitions representing territory,
commerce, and courtly influence. The theme functions as a mnemonic scaffold
rather than a simulation --- a Market lets you buy more, a Smithy draws more
cards, a Militia harasses opponents --- and Vaccarino has never pretended
otherwise. The medieval flavor provides just enough narrative logic that card
names stick in memory and new players can intuit effects before reading them.
The real theme of Dominion is not medieval governance but the joy of
combinatorial optimization: assembling a machine from parts and watching it run.

The Second Edition's card replacements are thematically interesting in what they
reveal about design priorities. Six cards from the original set were swapped out
--- not because of theme but because of play quality. Woodcutter and Chancellor
were replaced by Merchant and Harbinger, cards that create more interesting
decisions. The Throne Room stays; the Adventurer goes. These substitutions
acknowledge that in a mechanics-first game, the theme must follow the gameplay,
not the reverse. The new cards maintain the medieval naming convention (Bandit,
Sentry, Poacher, Artisan) while providing cleaner, more engaging mechanical
effects. The theme bends to serve the system, which is exactly how Dominion
has always operated.

What gives Dominion its distinctive feel is not the medieval dressing but the
physical experience of the deck itself. Shuffling, drawing, playing cards in
sequence, watching your discard pile grow, anticipating the next shuffle ---
these tactile rhythms are the game's true thematic identity. Your deck is a
living system that you cultivate, and the shuffle is the moment of harvest
where you discover what your cultivation has produced. The Second Edition
preserves this identity completely while refining the card pool to make the
cultivation more consistently rewarding.

### Core Loop

Each player starts with an identical 10-card deck: 7 Coppers (1 coin each)
and 3 Estates (1 VP each, no gameplay function). The supply contains treasure
cards (Copper, Silver, Gold), victory cards (Estate, Duchy, Province), a Curse
pile, and 10 Kingdom card piles selected for each game. Each turn follows
three phases:

1. ACTION PHASE --- Play one action card from your hand.
   a) Resolve the card's effects (draw cards, gain coins, gain actions, gain
      buys, attack opponents, trash cards, etc.)
   b) If the card or a previously played card grants "+1 Action" or "+2
      Actions," you may play additional action cards after resolving
   c) Chain actions by playing cards that grant actions, then using those
      actions to play further cards
   d) Reaction cards (like Moat) may be revealed from hand in response to
      attack cards played by opponents, even outside your turn
   e) If no action cards in hand or you choose not to play, skip this phase

2. BUY PHASE --- Play all treasure cards from your hand.
   a) Count total coins: treasure card values plus coins generated by action
      cards during the action phase
   b) Purchase one card from the supply costing up to your total coins
      (additional buys available if gained through action cards)
   c) The purchased card goes to your discard pile, not your hand --- it
      enters circulation only after your next shuffle
   d) You may choose not to buy anything

3. CLEANUP PHASE --- All played cards and remaining hand cards go to the
   discard pile. Draw 5 new cards from your draw deck. If the draw deck is
   empty, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw deck, then finish
   drawing. Your turn ends.

**End Condition**: The game ends immediately when the Province pile is empty
OR when any three supply piles are empty. Count total VP across all cards in
your deck (hand, draw pile, discard pile). Highest total wins; ties broken by
fewest turns taken.

### Key Design Patterns

CURATED CARD POOL AS DESIGN REFINEMENT: The Second Edition's most significant
contribution is demonstrating that a game's card pool is a design parameter
that can be iterated post-publication. Vaccarino replaced six underperforming
cards (Adventurer, Chancellor, Feast, Spy, Thief, Woodcutter) with six that
create more interesting decisions (Artisan, Bandit, Harbinger, Merchant,
Poacher, Sentry). The replacements are not power-crept --- they are
decision-enriched. Woodcutter offered a flat +1 Buy +2 Coins with no
interesting choice; Merchant offers +1 Card +1 Action plus a conditional Silver
bonus that rewards deck composition awareness. This approach treats game design
as a living craft where released products can be improved, a philosophy now
common in digital games but rare in physical ones.

DECK POLLUTION AS CORE TENSION: The fundamental strategic dilemma remains
unchanged from the original: victory point cards are necessary to win but
harmful to draw. Estates, Duchies, and Provinces produce no coins, grant no
actions, and occupy hand slots that could hold productive cards. Every VP
purchase dilutes the deck. The timing question --- when to pivot from engine
building to point acquisition --- is Dominion's central strategic challenge.
Begin buying Provinces too early and your engine collapses under dead draws.
Begin too late and opponents accumulate an insurmountable VP lead. The Second
Edition's card pool does not alter this tension but provides more tools for
managing it, including Sentry's ability to trash unhelpful cards and
Harbinger's ability to retrieve specific cards from the discard pile.

VARIABLE SETUP AS INFINITE REPLAYABILITY: Each game uses 10 of the available
Kingdom card piles, selected randomly or by agreement. Because the available
actions define the strategic landscape, every combination plays differently.
A setup with Sentry and Chapel enables aggressive deck thinning. A setup
with Village and Smithy rewards draw-engine construction. A setup with
Militia and Moat creates an attack-and-defense dynamic. The 26 Kingdom cards
in the Second Edition base set alone produce over 5 million possible 10-card
setups. The deepest Dominion skill is not executing a known strategy but
reading a novel setup and identifying which strategy it supports.

OPEN DRAFTING VERSUS BLIND DRAWING: The Second Edition adds Open Drafting to
Dominion's mechanical vocabulary through cards like Artisan (gain a card
costing up to 5 coins to your hand) and Bandit (gain a Gold, attack opponents'
decks). These effects bypass the normal buy-and-shuffle cycle by placing cards
directly into hand or onto the draw deck. The open drafting element creates
a secondary acquisition channel alongside the traditional buy phase, giving
players more ways to build their decks and more decisions per turn about which
channel to use.

ATTACK-REACTION PAIRING AS SOCIAL CALIBRATION: Attack cards (Militia, Bandit,
Witch) and the Moat reaction create an opt-in interaction layer. If no attack
cards appear in the setup, the game is a parallel optimization puzzle. If
attacks are present, players must decide whether to invest in Moats, in attack
cards of their own, or in engines robust enough to absorb the damage. The
Second Edition's attack cards are better calibrated than the originals: Bandit
replaces the clunky Thief with a cleaner attack that also gives you a Gold,
and the removed Spy eliminated the tedious deck-peeking that slowed the
original game. The attack-reaction pairing lets each game's setup determine
its own interaction level.

DELAYED PURCHASE AS TEMPORAL PLANNING: Cards bought during the Buy phase go to
the discard pile, meaning they enter your hand only after the next shuffle.
This delay creates multi-turn planning horizons. A Silver purchased now
improves buying power several turns later. The delay also makes shuffle timing
strategically relevant: buying a card just before a shuffle integrates it
quickly, while buying one just after means a long wait. Expert players track
their remaining deck size and shuffle proximity to optimize purchase timing,
adding a layer of information management beneath the visible card play.

SIMPLICITY AS SCALABLE ARCHITECTURE: Dominion's three-phase turn (Action, Buy,
Cleanup) is one of the simplest core loops in modern game design. The genius is
that complexity scales through card content, not rule additions. Every new
Kingdom card adds strategic possibilities without adding rules overhead ---
each card explains itself. This architecture allows Dominion to span a massive
complexity range: a game with Market, Village, and Smithy plays as a gentle
introduction, while a game with Throne Room, Library, and Chapel demands expert
combinatorial planning. The same three rules govern both experiences.

### What Makes It #177

Dominion: Second Edition is the refined expression of the most influential
game design of the twenty-first century. The original Dominion invented the
deckbuilding genre and proved that a thirty-minute card game could deliver
strategic depth rivaling much heavier designs. The Second Edition does not
change that formula but polishes it, replacing six cards that had become
recognized weaknesses with six that create richer decisions. Its position at
#177 --- alongside hundreds of deckbuilders it directly inspired --- reflects
the reality that the original invention remains mechanically excellent even as
the genre it created has matured around it. The variable setup ensures the
game never fully solves, the three-phase turn structure remains a model of
accessible elegance, and the core tension between engine efficiency and
victory point pollution is as compelling now as it was when Vaccarino first
proved that your deck could be the entire game.
