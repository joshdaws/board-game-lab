### Theme Integration

Wyrmspan reimagines the engine-building framework of Wingspan through the lens of
dragon mythology. Where Wingspan placed players as bird enthusiasts building
wildlife preserves, Wyrmspan casts them as dragon keepers excavating and
populating a vast cave system beneath a mountainous landscape. The shift from
ornithological accuracy to mythological fantasy is not merely cosmetic; it
fundamentally reshapes the game's relationship between theme and mechanics. In
Wingspan, the 170 bird cards were constrained by biological reality --- habitats,
diets, and behaviors had to match real species. In Wyrmspan, the fantasy setting
liberates card design. Dragons can inhabit Crimson Caverns, Golden Grottos, or
Amethyst Abysses --- three cave habitats that replace Wingspan's Forest, Grassland,
and Wetland --- and their abilities can range from hoarding treasure to breathing
fire to summoning magical effects, unconstrained by zoological fidelity.

The cave system metaphor extends beyond aesthetics into the core spatial mechanic.
Rather than placing birds in a flat tableau of habitat rows, players excavate deeper
into their cave system, with each dragon placed further from the entrance requiring
more resources to reach but unlocking more powerful activation chains. The
descending geography creates an intuitive sense of exploration and discovery that
reinforces the fantasy theme: the deeper you dig, the more powerful and ancient
the dragons you uncover. The three cave types map to the game's resource economy
much as Wingspan's habitats did --- one cave focuses on acquiring food (meat, gems,
and other dragon sustenance), another on egg production (dragon breeding), and
the third on drawing new dragon cards from the shared display --- but the fantasy
framing makes these resource loops feel like discovery rather than administration.

Wyrmspan also introduces a Guild system --- a shared advancement track where
players earn coins and bonuses for reaching milestones --- that replaces Wingspan's
between-round scoring goals. This system adds a persistent progression element
that gives the game more of a campaign feel, where your investment in dragon-
keeping pays dividends through guild recognition. The coins earned through the
Guild serve as a secondary currency that can be spent to acquire dragons, dig new
cave spaces, or activate special abilities, adding a layer of economic planning
absent from the original Wingspan design.

### Core Loop

The game spans four rounds with a decreasing number of turns per round, following
a similar pacing arc to Wingspan. Each round, players take turns performing one
action until all turns are exhausted. The action count decreases across rounds,
creating the same investment-to-exploitation arc that defines the Wingspan family.
On each turn, a player performs one of two actions:

1. PLAY A DRAGON --- Select a dragon card from hand and pay its food cost from
   your personal supply. Pay any additional excavation cost if the cave space has
   not yet been dug (coins or resources to open new spaces deeper in the cave).
   Place the dragon in the leftmost available space of one of your three cave rows
   (Crimson Caverns, Golden Grottos, or Amethyst Abyss). Resolve any "when
   played" ability immediately. The dragon is now permanently part of that cave
   row's engine.

2. EXPLORE A CAVE ROW --- Place your explorer token at the entrance of one of
   your three cave rows and move it rightward through the row, activating the base
   cave benefit first (gain food, lay eggs, or draw dragon cards), then resolving
   each dragon's "when activated" power from left to right as the explorer passes
   through. More dragons in the row means more activations per exploration action.
   The explorer moves along the track, triggering each dragon sequentially, creating
   a chain of effects that grows more powerful as the row fills.

Between-turn abilities on some dragons activate during opponents' turns,
maintaining engagement during downtime. Once-per-game abilities offer powerful
single-use effects that create strategic timing decisions.

At the end of each round, Guild advancement is resolved and bonuses are awarded
based on public objective criteria. After four rounds, final scoring tallies: dragon
point values, bonus card objectives, Guild milestones, eggs (1 VP each), cached
resources on certain dragons, and coins.

### Key Design Patterns

CAVE EXCAVATION AS INVESTMENT GATEWAY: Wyrmspan's cave system introduces an
excavation cost absent from Wingspan's open habitat rows. Before placing a dragon
in a deeper cave space, the player must first spend coins or resources to dig that
space, creating a two-phase investment: pay to unlock the space, then pay to place
the dragon. This adds a strategic layer where players must decide how deep to
excavate each cave. Shallow caves are cheap to develop but generate short
activation chains. Deep caves require significant upfront investment but create
powerful multi-dragon sequences once fully populated. The excavation system also
creates natural pacing --- early game turns are spent opening cave spaces and
placing foundational dragons, while late game turns exploit long chains of
activations through deeply excavated rows.

ENGINE-BUILDING WITH SEQUENTIAL ACTIVATION: Like Wingspan, Wyrmspan's core
strategic tension lies in the tradeoff between building the engine (playing dragons)
and running it (exploring caves). Each dragon placed in a row adds one more
activation to future exploration actions, but placing it consumed a turn that could
have been spent activating the existing chain. The sequential activation mechanic ---
where the explorer moves rightward through the row, triggering each dragon in
order --- means that dragon placement sequence matters. A dragon that draws
additional cards should be placed early in the row (triggered first), while a dragon
that scores points based on accumulated resources should be placed later (triggered
after resource-generating dragons have fired). This positional optimization adds
strategic depth beyond simple card evaluation.

GUILD TRACK AS SHARED PROGRESSION: The Guild system replaces Wingspan's
competitive end-of-round goals with a shared advancement track where players
earn coins and bonuses for reaching milestones tied to various achievements
(dragons played, eggs laid, resources cached, etc.). This shift from competitive
majority scoring to personal achievement thresholds reduces the direct confrontation
of round-end scoring while introducing a persistent progression system that
rewards consistent investment. The Guild track also serves as the primary source of
coins, making it an essential economic engine rather than a bonus scoring
opportunity. Players who neglect Guild advancement may find themselves unable to
afford cave excavation in later rounds.

RESOURCE TRINITY WITH COIN ADDITION: Wyrmspan preserves Wingspan's three-
resource dependency loop (food for playing dragons, eggs for scoring and placement
costs, cards as the dragons themselves) while adding coins as a fourth resource
tied to cave excavation and Guild advancement. Coins create additional decision
pressure: they are earned primarily through Guild milestones and certain dragon
abilities, and spent primarily on excavation, creating a separate economic loop that
intersects with but does not replace the food/eggs/cards triangle. A player focused
on deep cave excavation needs heavy coin income, pulling attention toward Guild
advancement and coin-producing dragons at the cost of food or egg production.

FANTASY THEME AS DESIGN LIBERATION: The shift from real birds to mythological
dragons freed the design from Wingspan's biological constraints. Dragon abilities can
be more varied, more powerful, and more thematically dramatic than bird abilities
without breaking immersion. A dragon that hoards treasure (caching coins for VP) or
breathes fire (removing opponent resources) does not need ornithological
justification. This design liberation allows Wyrmspan to explore mechanical
territory that Wingspan's realism could not, including more aggressive inter-player
effects and more spectacular individual card abilities. The fantasy setting also
creates natural visual hierarchy --- epic, powerful dragons look appropriately
magnificent on the card art, supporting the emotional satisfaction of playing
high-cost, high-impact creatures.

DECREASING TURNS AS COMPRESSION ARC: Following Wingspan's proven pacing
formula, the decreasing turn count across four rounds creates a natural arc from
investment to exploitation. Early rounds provide more turns for engine construction
(excavating caves, placing foundational dragons, establishing resource flows) while
later rounds compress available actions, forcing players to extract maximum value
from completed engine chains. The tension between "I need more turns to build" and
"each turn I run my engine produces increasingly powerful results" is the game's
emotional throughline, identical in structure to Wingspan but enhanced by the
thematic satisfaction of seeing a cave system that was empty in round one
producing cascading dragon abilities in round four.

BONUS CARDS AS STRATEGIC DIRECTION: Secret bonus cards provide end-game scoring
for specific dragon collections --- by cave type, by food preference, by size category,
by elemental affinity. These function identically to Wingspan's bonus card system,
providing asymmetric starting conditions that nudge card evaluation throughout the
game without mandating specific strategies. A bonus card rewarding "dragons in the
Amethyst Abyss" pushes the player toward deep investment in that cave row while
still allowing flexibility if the card display does not cooperate.

OPEN DRAFT AS CARD EVALUATION CHALLENGE: The face-up dragon card display
(supplemented by blind draws from the deck) creates a shared information
environment where all players can see which dragons are available. The open draft
generates indirect interaction --- taking a dragon denies it to opponents, and
monitoring which cave types and food preferences opponents are collecting informs
defensive drafting decisions. The large deck of unique dragon cards ensures that
no two games present the same optimization landscape, requiring adaptive strategy
rather than memorized solutions.

### What Makes It #125

Wyrmspan demonstrates that a great game system can be meaningfully reimagined
rather than merely reskinned. The cave excavation mechanic adds an investment
gateway that Wingspan lacked, creating deeper strategic commitment through the
two-phase cost of excavation plus dragon placement. The Guild track replaces
competitive round scoring with persistent progression that feeds back into the
economy through coin generation. And the fantasy theme liberates card design
from biological constraints, allowing more dramatic abilities and more varied
strategic archetypes. Yet Wyrmspan preserves the core insight that made Wingspan
successful: the engine-building tension between adding components and activating
them, compressed through decreasing turn counts that force players to commit to
strategies early and execute them efficiently. At weight 2.82, Wyrmspan occupies
a slightly higher complexity tier than Wingspan's 2.48, reflecting the added depth
of cave excavation and coin management without abandoning the accessibility that
made the original a crossover success. It proves that the Wingspan engine-building
framework has room to grow --- upward in complexity, downward into the earth, and
outward into fantasy.
