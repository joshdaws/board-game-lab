## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Champions of Midgard casts players as Viking leaders defending a besieged
harbor town from trolls, draugr, and sea monsters drawn from Norse mythology.
The theme is not an overlay — it structures the game's entire economy and
decision space. Workers placed on town locations represent your warband
recruiting soldiers, gathering food and wood, visiting the stave church for
blessings, or consulting the runesmith for mystical aid. The warriors you
recruit are dice, color-coded by type (swordsmen, spearmen, axemen), and
combat is resolved by rolling them against monsters whose toughness and
special abilities demand different warrior compositions. The visceral act
of rolling handfuls of dice to fight trolls creates an emotional connection
to the Viking fantasy that no deterministic combat system could replicate —
you feel the uncertainty of battle, and the elation of a lucky roll genuinely
evokes the sensation of your warriors prevailing against terrible odds.

The journey mechanic deepens the thematic integration. To fight the most
rewarding monsters — sea creatures lurking in distant waters — players must
load warriors and food onto longships and brave a sea voyage with random
encounter cards. Storms can drown warriors, sea serpents can attack, and
insufficient food causes starvation. This journey phase transforms a
straightforward worker-placement game into a risk-management narrative: you
are not just allocating resources, you are sending warriors on a dangerous
expedition and hoping they arrive intact. The food requirement for journeys
is particularly thematic — a Viking longship without provisions is a death
sentence, and the game makes you feel the logistical burden of overseas
raiding alongside its glory.

The town's defense adds a communal pressure that prevents players from
ignoring local threats in pursuit of personal glory. Each round, a troll
or draugr attacks the town, and a player must commit warriors to fight it.
Defeating the local threat earns modest glory; failing to defeat it costs
the responsible player reputation (negative points). This creates a tension
between civic duty and personal ambition that resonates with the Norse
cultural context — a jarl who abandons the town to raid foreign shores
is no hero, regardless of the treasure brought home.

### Core Loop

The game plays over eight rounds, each divided into four phases:

**Phase 1 — Worker Placement**

1. PLACE WORKERS — In turn order, each player places one worker at a time
   on available town locations. Each location provides a specific benefit:
   a) SWORDSMITH / SPEARSMITH / AXESMITH — Recruit warrior dice of the
      corresponding type (red swords, grey spears, yellow axes).
   b) SMOKEHOUSE — Collect food tokens, required for sea voyages.
   c) SHIPWRIGHT — Acquire a longship card, needed to transport warriors
      on sea journeys.
   d) STAVE CHURCH — Gain a blessing card that provides rerolls, bonus
      hits, or damage prevention in combat.
   e) RUNESMITH — Acquire rune cards that provide ongoing or one-time
      special abilities.
   f) MERCHANT SHIP — Trade goods for coins or exchange resources.
   g) SAGE — Draw destiny cards that provide endgame set-collection scoring.
   h) JARL'S LONGHOUSE — Claim first player for the next round and gain a
      small bonus.

   Most locations accommodate only one worker, creating competition for
   critical resources.

2. ASSIGN TO BATTLES — After all workers are placed, each player privately
   decides how to allocate their recruited warriors. Warriors can be
   assigned to:
   a) LOCAL DEFENSE — Fight the troll or draugr currently threatening the
      town.
   b) SEA JOURNEY — Board a longship to fight a sea monster at a distant
      location. Requires food and a ship.
   c) RESERVE — Hold warriors for future rounds (limited by storage capacity).

**Phase 2 — Sea Journey Resolution**

1. JOURNEY CARDS — Each player who sent warriors on a sea journey draws a
   journey card and resolves its effect. Effects range from benign (calm
   seas, no effect) to devastating (storms that kill warriors, shortages
   that consume extra food). Players who did not pack enough food lose
   warriors to starvation.

2. Players who survive the journey proceed to fight the sea monster at
   their destination.

**Phase 3 — Combat Resolution**

1. LOCAL BATTLE — The player assigned to fight the town's attacker rolls
   their committed warrior dice. Each die face shows either a hit, a
   double hit, or a blank. Swords hit more reliably, spears have a chance
   of double hits, and axes are volatile (more blanks but also more double
   hits). Blessing cards may be spent for rerolls or bonus hits. If total
   hits meet or exceed the monster's toughness, the player wins glory
   (victory points) and any listed rewards. If not, the monster deals
   damage (killing warrior dice) and the player suffers a blame token
   worth negative VP.

2. SEA BATTLES — Each player fighting a sea monster resolves combat
   similarly. Sea monsters are generally tougher but more rewarding than
   local threats. Some sea monsters have special abilities (regeneration,
   armor, fear effects) that require specific warrior compositions to
   counter effectively.

**Phase 4 — Cleanup**

1. Remove the defeated or undefeated monsters. Reveal new monsters for the
   next round — one local threat and new sea-journey destinations.
2. Pass the first-player marker if claimed. Begin the next round.

**End Game**: After eight rounds, players total glory from defeated monsters,
fulfilled destiny cards (set collection), coins, and remaining resources.
Subtract blame tokens from undefeated local threats. Highest total wins.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE AS WARRIORS AS RISK CALCULUS: The central design insight of Champions of
Midgard is representing warriors as dice, making combat strength probabilistic
rather than deterministic. Recruiting three swordsmen does not guarantee three
hits — it guarantees three rolls with a certain hit probability. This
transforms army building from a math problem (do I have enough strength?) into
a risk assessment (do I have enough EXPECTED strength, and can I tolerate the
variance?). The three warrior types offer different risk profiles: swordsmen
are consistent (high hit probability, low ceiling), spearmen are balanced
(moderate hit chance with double-hit potential), and axemen are volatile (many
blanks but the highest damage ceiling). Composing an army means choosing a
risk profile, and blessings function as variance reducers (rerolls, guaranteed
hits) that let players manage their exposure to bad luck. Steiness understood
that dice combat is not about randomness — it is about giving players tools
to shape their relationship with randomness.

WORKER PLACEMENT WITH COMBAT PAYOFF: Most worker-placement games convert
placed workers into resources, then resources into victory points through
some conversion engine. Champions of Midgard adds a dramatic intermediary:
combat. Workers acquire warriors, food, ships, and blessings — but these
resources are not directly converted to points. They are invested in battles
whose outcomes are uncertain. This structure means the worker-placement phase
is not an optimization exercise but a preparation phase: you are equipping
an expedition, not running a production chain. The emotional arc of the game
follows this structure — careful planning during worker placement gives way
to dramatic tension during combat resolution, creating a rhythm of strategy
and excitement that pure worker-placement games lack.

JOURNEY AS RISK LAYER: The sea-journey mechanic adds an entire risk dimension
between resource acquisition and combat. Even after recruiting warriors and
packing food, players face random journey events that can decimate their
forces before battle begins. This additional uncertainty layer creates
meaningful decisions about over-preparation: do you recruit extra warriors
as insurance against journey losses, or do you allocate minimally and hope
for calm seas? The journey also creates opportunity cost — warriors sent to
sea cannot defend the town, and resources spent on food and ships cannot be
used elsewhere. The journey mechanic transforms what could be a simple "place
workers, fight monsters" loop into a multi-stage risk management pipeline
where each stage introduces new uncertainty.

BLAME AS COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY: The local-defense mechanic requires
someone to fight the town's attacker each round, and failure results in
blame tokens (negative VP). This creates a social dynamic absent from most
worker-placement games: players must negotiate (implicitly or explicitly) who
bears the civic burden of town defense. The player with the most warriors
SHOULD fight the troll, but those warriors might be better invested in a
lucrative sea journey. Blame is the game's stick — it punishes selfishness
not through direct player conflict but through communal obligation. The
mechanic prevents the degenerate strategy of ignoring local threats entirely,
and it creates interesting moments where a player accepts blame intentionally,
calculating that the sea-journey rewards outweigh the penalty.

DESTINY CARDS AS SET COLLECTION ENDGAME: Destiny cards provide endgame
scoring based on set collection — defeating specific combinations of monster
types, collecting certain resources, or achieving combat milestones. These
cards create divergent strategic paths within the shared worker-placement
framework. One player might prioritize sea monsters to fulfill a "defeat
three sea creatures" destiny, while another focuses on local trolls to
satisfy a different set. Destiny cards solve the problem of many worker-
placement games where all players pursue identical strategies; they give each
player a private objective that shapes their public decisions without
requiring hidden information or asymmetric starting conditions.

VARIABLE PLAYER POWERS AS STRATEGIC IDENTITY: Each Viking leader provides a
unique ongoing ability — one might gain extra food from the smokehouse,
another might roll an extra die in sea battles, a third might draw additional
blessing cards. These powers are modest enough to avoid determining strategy
but significant enough to create preferential paths through the decision
space. The player with a combat bonus naturally gravitates toward tougher
monsters; the player with a resource bonus can afford to be more aggressive
with sea journeys. Variable powers ensure that the optimal strategy differs
by player, reducing the "solved game" problem that plagues symmetric worker-
placement designs.

WARRIOR TYPE TRIANGLE AS COMPOSITION PUZZLE: The three warrior types create
a soft rock-paper-scissors dynamic against different monster abilities.
Monsters with armor reduce single hits (punishing reliable swordsmen),
monsters with fear effects remove dice before rolling (punishing small
armies of powerful axemen), and monsters with regeneration require sustained
damage output (rewarding spearmen's double-hit potential). This triangular
relationship means army composition matters beyond raw dice count, and
players must scout upcoming monsters to recruit appropriately. The warrior
triangle adds strategic depth to what could be a simple "more dice = better"
calculation without requiring complex combat rules.

### What Makes It #164

Champions of Midgard earns its position by solving a problem that many
thematic worker-placement games face: making the conversion of resources
to victory points feel dramatic rather than mechanical. The dice-as-warriors
system means that combat outcomes are uncertain, and the journey phase means
that even reaching combat is not guaranteed. Every decision in the worker-
placement phase carries forward into a cascade of probability and risk that
makes the payoff feel earned rather than calculated. At 2.63 weight, the
game is accessible enough to serve as a gateway to worker-placement design
while offering enough strategic texture — through warrior composition, journey
risk management, destiny card specialization, and the blame dynamic — to
reward repeated play. Steiness proved that adding dice to worker placement
is not a concession to casual players but a design choice that creates
emotional range no deterministic system can match.
