## Design Notes

Designers: Matt Leacock and Rob Daviau. Published by Z-Man Games (2015).

### Theme Integration

Four diseases are sweeping the planet. Your team of CDC specialists must
travel the globe, treat outbreaks, and discover cures before time runs out.
The cooperative framing isn't decorative — it shapes every decision. Players
openly discuss strategy, share cards, and coordinate movement. The map is the
real world (48 cities across 6 regions), making outbreaks in familiar cities
feel personal. The Legacy layer adds narrative weight: diseases get names you
invent, characters accumulate scars, cities fall into panic. By December,
your copy of the game is a physical artifact of your group's story.

### Core Loop

Each player turn has 3 phases:

1. DO 4 ACTIONS - Move (Drive/Ferry, Direct Flight, Charter Flight, Shuttle
   Flight), Treat Disease, Share Knowledge, Build a Structure, Discover a Cure.
   Any combination, repeats allowed.
2. DRAW 2 PLAYER CARDS - City cards (hand building toward cures) and Event
   cards (special abilities). Epidemic cards trigger disease escalation.
3. INFECT CITIES - Flip Infection cards equal to current infection rate, place
   disease cubes. Cities with 3+ cubes of one color trigger outbreaks.

Win condition: Complete all mandatory objectives (initially: cure all 4
diseases). Loss conditions: 8 outbreaks, run out of disease cubes of any
color, or run out of Player Deck cards.

### Key Design Patterns

THE LEGACY FRAMEWORK: The defining innovation. The game spans 12 in-game
months (January-December), with up to 24 sessions (2 attempts per month).
Every session permanently alters the game: stickers on the board, stickers
on cards, rule stickers in the rulebook itself, torn-up cards, opened
packages, revealed dossiers. The rulebook ships INCOMPLETE — labeled blanks
(Rule Sticker A through Y) get filled as you play. The Legacy Deck is a
one-way narrative engine: read cards in order, stop when instructed, never
shuffle or reverse. This makes the game literally unreplayable — and that
constraint is the source of its power. Every decision matters because you
can't undo it.

HIDDEN INFORMATION AS PACING: Eight sealed packages and five sealed dossiers
sit in the box from day one. You don't know what's inside. The Legacy Deck
tells you when to open them. This creates genuine surprise — new components,
new rules, new threats appear mid-campaign. The physical act of tearing open
a package heightens the narrative stakes in a way no digital game can match.
The designers weaponize curiosity as a pacing mechanism.

PANIC LEVEL ESCALATION: Each city has a panic level that permanently
increases whenever it outbreaks. Four stages: Unstable (no effect), Rioting
(no Direct/Charter Flights, no research stations), Collapsing (costs 1 card
to enter), Fallen (costs 2 cards to enter). These are stickers — once placed,
they never come off. Over the campaign, the map physically deteriorates.
Some cities become no-go zones. The board tells the story of your failures.

SCARS AND LOST CHARACTERS: Characters accumulate scars from being in
outbreak cities. Each scar permanently alters the character (future effects
determined by rule stickers). When a character fills all scar slots, they're
LOST — you physically destroy their card. Gone from this game and all future
games. Character death isn't a restart; it's permanent narrative consequence.
This creates genuine emotional attachment to cardboard people.

FUNDING AS ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY: Your Funding Level (0-10) determines how
many Funded Event cards go into the Player Deck each game. Win = funding
drops by 2 (government gets complacent). Lose = funding rises by 2
(emergency response). This is an elegant rubber-band mechanic: struggling
groups get more tools, dominant groups face tighter constraints. It also
simulates real institutional behavior — agencies fund crises, not prevention.

EPIDEMIC CARD DESIGN: The Epidemic sequence (Increase infection rate, Infect
from bottom of deck, Intensify by shuffling discard onto top) is a masterclass
in tension engineering. Drawing from the BOTTOM means any city can get hit.
Reshuffling discards ON TOP means recently infected cities WILL get hit again.
The infection deck becomes a ticking time bomb where you know approximately
what's coming but not exactly when. This transforms random card draws into
probabilistic risk assessment.

DUAL-USE CITY CARDS: City cards serve three purposes: they're the raw
material for curing diseases (collect 5 of one color), they're movement
currency (discard for Direct/Charter Flight), and they can have stickers
applied during the Legacy campaign that add permanent effects. Using a card
for movement means it's not available for curing. The Researcher character
can give ANY card (not just matching city), making her a logistics hub.

GAME END UPGRADES: Win or lose, each session ends with two permanent
upgrades: new research stations (starting locations for future games),
character upgrades (stickers on character cards), positive mutations
(diseases become easier to cure), or unfunded events (permanent additions
to the Player Deck). This means even losses advance your capabilities.
The campaign never feels hopeless because you're always getting stronger.

COOPERATIVE DESIGN CONSTRAINTS: Open hands (all cards face-up), open
discussion, but the active player decides. Share Knowledge requires
co-location AND the card must match the city you're both in (except
Researcher). This prevents quarterbacking while enabling coordination.
The 7-card hand limit creates pressure to actually use cards rather than
hoard. Event cards can be played "between" actions on any player's turn,
giving reactive options without adding complexity.

CHARACTER ASYMMETRY: Five starting roles with meaningfully different
abilities. Dispatcher moves other players' pawns (coordination). Medic
removes ALL cubes of one color (efficiency). Scientist needs only 4 cards
to cure (speed). Researcher shares any card (logistics). Generalist gets
5 actions per turn (flexibility). Each role creates a distinct play
experience within the cooperative framework. The Legacy layer adds more
characters and modifications over time.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 2 players: 4 cards each at start
- 3 players: 3 cards each at start
- 4 players: 2 cards each at start
- Funding Level adjusts difficulty across the campaign (0-10 Event cards)
- Same board/map regardless of player count

### What Makes It #3

The Legacy format turned board gaming into appointment television. Groups
scheduled monthly sessions. People talked about their campaigns the way they
talk about TV seasons — "Our Chicago fell in March" or "We lost the Medic in
July." The permanent consequences give every decision genuine weight. The
adaptive difficulty (Funding) keeps it accessible. And underneath the Legacy
innovations, the base Pandemic engine is beautifully tuned: the Epidemic
shuffle mechanic creates perfect tension, the cooperative structure generates
real group dynamics, and the 4-action economy keeps turns crisp. Leacock and
Daviau proved that a board game can be a consumable experience — played once,
cherished forever — and that constraint makes it more meaningful, not less.
