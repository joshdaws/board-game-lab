### Theme Integration

Obsession is one of the most thematically committed games in modern design.
Players are heads of declining Victorian gentry families, scrambling to restore
their country estates to former glory in time to attract the attention of the
visiting Fairchild family and their eligible heir. Every mechanical system in
the game maps to a social reality of 19th-century English aristocracy. Guests
are not abstract worker tokens but named individuals with specific social
standing -- casual acquaintances, prestige guests, and distinguished members of
the gentry -- each bringing different capabilities depending on their class. The
fact that guests must "rest" after attending an event is not merely a cooldown
timer; it models the social reality that you cannot invite the same person to
your estate every weekend without seeming desperate.

The service staff system reinforces class dynamics with equal precision. You
need a butler, a valet, a lady's maid, a footman, or an underbutler to host
events, and different events require different combinations. This is not an
abstraction -- these were the actual roles that maintained a Victorian
household, and the game quietly teaches players about the domestic service
hierarchy. Hosting a formal dinner requires more staff than an afternoon tea,
just as it would have in 1860. The tile-based estate itself grows from a modest
starting manor into a sprawling complex of gardens, sporting grounds, drawing
rooms, and servants' quarters, each new improvement unlocking more prestigious
events and attracting higher-status guests.

The courtship of the Fairchild heir serves as both thematic centerpiece and
structural timer. The Fairchild family is visiting the region, evaluating which
family is most worthy of a marriage alliance. This shared objective creates a
quiet race among all players, grounding the competitive tension in a
historically authentic social ritual. The Fairchilds do not care only about
wealth -- they evaluate reputation, estate quality, and social connections,
meaning players must develop across multiple dimensions rather than optimizing a
single axis.

### Core Loop

The game plays over 16 rounds divided into four seasons, with a Theme Card
drawn each season that establishes what the Fairchild family values (one of five
improvement categories: Essentials, Service, Estate, Prestige, or Sporting).
Each round follows this structure:

1. ROTATE SERVICE - Move servants from the Servants' Quarters to Available
   Service (now usable this turn). Move servants from Expended Service to the
   Servants' Quarters (still resting). Guests in the discard pile remain
   unavailable until the player passes to reclaim them.
2. HOST ACTIVITY - Choose one of your estate tiles to activate. Each tile
   specifies a required servant and invites one or more guests from your
   available hand. The tile and guest cards provide rewards: money, reputation,
   and invitations to new guests.
3. PROVIDE SERVICE - Place the matching servants from Available Service onto
   the improvement tile and guest cards.
4. ENJOY FAVOURS - Collect all benefits from the hosted activity: pounds,
   reputation, and new gentry cards as indicated on the tile and guests.
5. CLEAR BOARD AND BUY - Move used servants to Expended Service, return the
   improvement tile to the organiser, and place attending gentry below the
   player board. Then optionally purchase an estate tile from the builder's
   market (a rotating display of rooms, gardens, and service buildings).

At the end of each four-round season, a courtship event is scored, awarding
bonus VP to the player who best matches the current Theme Card's category.
After the fourth season, final scoring combines estate value, guest prestige,
reputation track position, courtship bonuses, and objective cards.

### Key Design Patterns

GUEST ROTATION AS HAND MANAGEMENT: Guests function like a hand of cards, but
with a physical cooldown mechanic. After attending an event, a guest is
unavailable for one or more rounds. This transforms hand management from a
problem of card draw into a problem of scheduling. You can see your entire
roster at all times -- there is no hidden information in your guest pool -- but
the rotation mechanic means you must plan two or three rounds ahead to ensure
the right guests are available when you need them. The design elegantly solves
the "best action every turn" problem without randomness: your constraints are
self-imposed by your previous hosting decisions.

SERVICE STAFF AS WORKER RESOURCE: The butler, valet, lady's maid, footman, and
underbutler are not interchangeable workers. Each estate tile requires a
specific combination, meaning you must build a staff roster that matches your
improvement strategy. Acquiring additional staff is expensive and slow, creating
a genuine bottleneck that forces players to specialize. A player who invests
heavily in outdoor sporting improvements needs different staff than one focused
on formal dining. This specificity prevents the common Euro problem where
workers are fungible and strategy collapses into "get more workers."

REPUTATION VS. PRESTIGE DUAL TRACKS: Reputation measures your family's social
standing in the community -- earned through hosting well-attended events and
maintaining a respectable estate. Prestige measures the quality and exclusivity
of your social circle -- earned by attracting and retaining high-status guests.
The two tracks create a genuine strategic fork. Reputation is more reliable and
accumulates steadily through consistent hosting. Prestige requires riskier
investments in expensive improvements and harder-to-acquire guests but pays off
more dramatically. The Courtship cards may reward either track, so players who
lean too hard in one direction gamble on which scoring criteria will appear.

COURTSHIP AS SHARED OBJECTIVE AND TIMER: The Fairchild courtship is structurally
brilliant because it serves three simultaneous functions. First, it is the
game's primary timer -- four seasons of four rounds creates a fixed 16-round
structure with clear intermediate scoring milestones. Second, it introduces
uncertainty about scoring priorities, since each season's Courtship card reveals
different evaluation criteria. Third, it provides thematic motivation for every
mechanical action. You are not building an estate in the abstract; you are
preparing for a specific social evaluation. This grounds the optimization puzzle
in narrative purpose and gives players a reason to care about their decisions
beyond point maximization.

TILE-BASED ESTATE BUILDING: The estate grows through physical tile placement,
with each tile representing a specific room or outdoor space. Tiles vary in
cost, staff requirements, guest capacity, and rewards. The spatial element is
light -- tiles are placed in a personal tableau rather than a shared board --
but the growing visual representation of your estate provides powerful
psychological feedback. A player with twelve beautifully arranged improvements
feels wealthy in a way that a simple VP track cannot replicate. The tile market
rotates each round, introducing drafting tension and forcing players to adapt
their estate plans to available options.

VICTORIAN SOCIAL HIERARCHY AS MECHANICAL CONSTRAINT: Guest cards are stratified
into distinct social classes, and higher-class guests produce more powerful
effects but are harder to acquire and maintain. Casual acquaintances are freely
available but generate modest returns. Prestige guests require reputation
thresholds to attract. Distinguished visitors demand both reputation and
specific estate improvements. This creates a natural progression curve where
early-game actions focus on building a foundation of modest guests and basic
improvements, while late-game actions leverage elite guests for dramatic scoring
turns. The hierarchy also interacts with the courtship system -- the Fairchilds
are more impressed by distinguished company than casual acquaintances.

THEME-FIRST DESIGN METHODOLOGY: Obsession represents a design philosophy where
theme precedes mechanics rather than the reverse. Hallagan started with the
question "what would it feel like to manage a Victorian estate?" and derived
every system from that premise. The result is a game where mechanical
explanations are unnecessary because the theme does the teaching. New players
understand why guests need rest, why staff have specific roles, and why the
Fairchild family's opinion matters, because these things make narrative sense
before they make mechanical sense. This is a reusable design insight: when theme
and mechanics are truly unified, rules complexity decreases even as strategic
depth increases.

ASYMMETRIC STARTING CONDITIONS: Each player family begins with a slightly
different estate, different starting guests, and different staff configurations.
These asymmetries are subtle enough that the game does not require variable
player powers or faction abilities, but meaningful enough to encourage different
opening strategies. One family might start with better outdoor facilities,
nudging them toward sporting events, while another begins with stronger indoor
hosting capabilities. The asymmetry creates replayability without the overhead
of learning distinct faction rules.

### What Makes It #66

Obsession succeeds by committing completely to its theme in a genre -- Euro-
style optimization games -- that typically treats theme as wallpaper. The guest
rotation mechanic is genuinely novel, transforming the familiar hand management
problem into something that feels like social scheduling rather than card
counting. The service staff system adds a specificity to worker placement that
most games avoid because it limits player freedom, but that limitation is
precisely what creates interesting decisions. And the Fairchild courtship gives
the entire game a narrative arc -- a beginning, middle, and end with rising
stakes -- that pure point-salad designs lack. It is not the heaviest or most
strategically deep game at this ranking, but it may be the most thematically
cohesive, proving that theme-first design can produce mechanically elegant
results.
