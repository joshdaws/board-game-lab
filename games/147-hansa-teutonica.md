### Theme Integration

Hansa Teutonica is set during the height of the Hanseatic League, the
medieval confederation of merchant guilds that dominated trade across
Northern Europe from the 13th to 15th centuries. Players represent rival
merchant houses establishing trading posts in cities connected by overland
routes. The map depicts the historical trade network from London through
the Low Countries and into the Baltic — Bruges, Hamburg, Lubeck, Danzig,
and beyond. Routes between cities have slots for merchants, and filling all
slots on a route allows you to establish a permanent trading post (kontore)
in an adjacent city. The mechanic mirrors the historical reality: the
Hanseatic League's power grew not from military conquest but from
systematically establishing commercial footholds along trade routes.

Where the theme does surprising structural work is in the displacement
mechanic. When you place a merchant on a route slot already occupied by
an opponent, you push their piece off — but you do not destroy it. Instead,
the displaced merchant is relocated to an adjacent empty slot for free,
effectively giving your opponent a bonus move. This models the competitive
cooperation that characterized Hanseatic commerce: rival merchants competed
fiercely for trade routes, but displacing a competitor from one route only
sent them to establish presence elsewhere. The League's power came from
the density of its network, not from exclusion. Steding's displacement
mechanic captures this paradox beautifully — aggression benefits the
target, forcing players to think carefully about when interference is worth
the cost of helping an opponent reposition.

The five personal skill tracks represent the professionalization and
institutional development that real merchant houses pursued. Actions per
turn (administrative capacity), books (scholarly and accounting expertise),
bag size (commercial reach), keys (privileged trading rights), and extra
actions (organizational efficiency) all map to historical capabilities
that successful Hanseatic merchant houses cultivated over generations. The
upgrade system models institutional growth: you invest in your
organization's capabilities to enable more efficient future operations. The
abstract feel that some players note is not a thematic failure — it is an
accurate representation of how medieval commerce actually functioned, as
an abstract network of contractual relationships rather than a narrative
of individual adventure.

### Core Loop

The game plays over a variable number of rounds until the end-game trigger
is reached (when a set number of bonus markers have been claimed). Each
player takes a turn consisting of a number of actions determined by their
current skill level on the actions track.

**On Your Turn (default 2 actions, upgradable to 5):**

1. PLACE A MERCHANT — Take a merchant from your personal supply and place
   it on an empty route slot adjacent to one of your existing merchants or
   trading posts. If the slot is occupied by an opponent, you may displace
   them by paying one additional action. The displaced piece is relocated
   to any adjacent empty slot (the opponent chooses where).

2. CLAIM A ROUTE — If all slots on a route between two cities are filled
   with your merchants, you may spend one action to claim the route.
   Remove your merchants from the route and establish a trading post
   (kontore) in one of the two connected cities, or use the route to
   upgrade one of your five personal skill tracks. Some cities have
   limited slots and require a minimum privilege level (key track) to
   place in.

3. UPGRADE A SKILL TRACK — Instead of establishing a trading post when
   claiming certain designated routes, you may advance one of five tracks:
   - ACTIONS: Increases your actions per turn (2 to 5)
   - BOOK: Increases VP value of each city in your largest network
   - BAG: Increases your supply of available merchants
   - KEY: Increases your privilege level for restricted cities
   - EXTRA ACTIONS: Grants bonus actions of specific types

4. COLLECT BONUS MARKERS — Claiming a route adjacent to a city with a
   bonus marker earns you that marker (VP, extra actions, or special
   abilities). When enough markers are claimed, the end game triggers.

5. OFFICE BONUSES — Some cities grant special abilities when you
   establish a trading post: extra merchants, additional actions, or
   the ability to swap merchant types.

**Scoring**: At game end, score points for: trading posts in cities with VP
values, bonus markers collected, your book track value multiplied by the
number of cities in your longest connected network of trading posts, and
bonus VP for controlling the most trading posts in specific high-value
cities (area majority).

### Key Design Patterns

BUILD YOUR OWN ACTION ECONOMY: The five personal skill tracks constitute
Hansa Teutonica's central design innovation. Every player starts with the
same baseline capabilities — two actions per turn, a small merchant supply,
no special privileges — and the entire game is about choosing which tracks
to upgrade and in what order. Upgrading the actions track from 2 to 5
actions per turn more than doubles your throughput, making it the most
obvious early investment, but the routes that enable action upgrades are
hotly contested. The book track is worthless early but can generate 15+
points at game end with a large connected network. The key track unlocks
access to restricted cities that are critical for certain strategies. The
skill track system means no two games follow the same trajectory — each
player is literally building a different engine, and the interaction between
engines determines the game's texture.

DISPLACEMENT AS BENEFICIAL AGGRESSION: The displacement mechanic is the
most counterintuitive design decision in the game, and it is what makes
Hansa Teutonica exceptional. Pushing an opponent's merchant off a route
costs you one extra action but gives them a free placement in an adjacent
slot. In most games, interfering with an opponent is purely adversarial.
Here, interference has a tangible cost to the aggressor and a tangible
benefit to the target. This means displacement is only strategically
correct when the cost to your opponent of losing their current position
outweighs the benefit of their free redeployment. The calculus is rarely
obvious, and it is what makes the game so interactive — every placement
near an opponent forces both players to evaluate a complex tradeoff. The
displacement mechanic also prevents route monopolization: you cannot simply
block a critical route indefinitely, because opponents can push you off.

NETWORK SCORING AS LATE-GAME MULTIPLIER: The book track provides VP equal
to its current value for every city in your longest connected network of
trading posts. A player with a book value of 4 and a network of 8 cities
scores 32 points from this alone — often the decisive scoring category.
But network connectivity requires sustained investment across many routes,
and the book track itself requires specific route claims to upgrade. The
network scoring creates a strategic tension: short-term tactics (grabbing
bonus markers, blocking opponents) versus long-term planning (building a
contiguous chain of trading posts). Players who focus exclusively on
network building are vulnerable to opponents who grab bonus markers and
trigger the game end before the network pays off.

ROUTE CONTROL AS MULTI-PURPOSE RESOURCE: Claiming a route is the game's
fundamental action, but it serves three distinct purposes: establishing a
trading post (for network scoring and area majority), upgrading a skill
track (for engine building), or collecting bonus markers (for immediate
VP). The same route cannot serve all three purposes — you must choose.
This multi-purpose design means every route claim involves an opportunity
cost calculation. Should you use this route to place a trading post in a
key city, or sacrifice the post to upgrade your actions track? The
decision depends on your overall strategy, the game state, and how many
turns remain before the end trigger. Steding made route claiming do
triple duty, and the strategic richness flows directly from this
overloaded mechanism.

VARIABLE GAME LENGTH AS PRESSURE MECHANISM: The game ends when a
configurable number of bonus markers have been claimed (varies by player
count and difficulty). Players who prioritize bonus markers accelerate
the game end, while players building long-term engines want the game to
last. This creates a natural tension between aggressive and deliberate
strategies. An action-economy player who upgrades all five tracks to
maximum is devastatingly powerful per-turn — but if the game ends
before those upgrades pay off, the investment is wasted. The variable
end condition means tempo itself is a contested resource, and controlling
the game's pace is as strategic as any board-level decision.

AREA MAJORITY IN KEY CITIES: Certain high-value cities award bonus points
to the player with the most trading posts. This area majority scoring
layer adds a second dimension of competition beyond network building.
Two players might both want trading posts in Lubeck for network reasons,
but the majority bonus makes the third or fourth post in that city
strategically significant even if it does not extend your network.
The area majority scoring also creates late-game drama, as players
compete to place final trading posts in contested cities before the
game ends.

EMERGENT PLAYER INTERACTION WITHOUT DIRECT CONFLICT: Hansa Teutonica has
no combat, no territory control in the traditional sense, and no resource
destruction. Yet it is one of the most interactive euros ever designed.
The interaction emerges from shared routes (finite slots that multiple
players need), displacement (the paradox of beneficial aggression), area
majority (competing for city control), and end-game timing (racing
versus building). Every action you take affects what opponents can do
on their turns, not through abstract mechanisms but through direct
spatial competition on a shared map. Steding proved that deep interaction
does not require conflict mechanics — it requires shared, contested,
finite resources.

### What Makes It #147

Hansa Teutonica occupies a rare design space: a euro game where every
action is directed at or in response to other players, yet no mechanism
involves direct destruction or punishment. The displacement mechanic alone
would secure the game's legacy — it solved the fundamental euro problem of
how to make player interaction meaningful without making it punishing. But
the combination of displacement, the build-your-own-action-economy skill
tracks, and the variable game length creates a system where aggressive,
defensive, and engine-building strategies all remain viable throughout.
At 3.09 weight, it delivers the interactive density of much heavier
games in under 90 minutes. Hansa Teutonica is a designer's game — its
mechanisms are transparent, its decisions are agonizing, and its replay
value comes entirely from the shifting dynamics of player interaction
rather than from randomness or scenario variety. It is the purest
expression of emergent euro interaction.
