### Theme Integration

The White Castle is set in Himeji Castle, the iconic white-walled fortress of
feudal Japan, and the game treats its setting as more than scenery. Players are
lords vying for influence within the castle's social and physical hierarchy,
deploying courtiers into the castle's three tiers, tending gardens below its
walls, and advancing warriors across the bridge toward the main keep. The
vertical structure of Himeji — its layered baileys rising toward the central
tenshu — is directly encoded in the game's spatial logic. Workers placed in
higher castle tiers are more prestigious and score more, but the actions
required to get them there demand careful sequencing and resource expenditure.

The dice drafting mechanism captures the feudal theme of constrained agency.
You are not rolling dice to test fate — you are selecting from a shared pool of
pre-rolled dice, choosing which resources and opportunities to claim while
leaving the remainder for your rivals. The dice values do not represent luck;
they represent the quality of the opportunities available in a given season.
A high-value die placed on the garden action yields a larger bonus; a low-value
die placed on the same spot costs less to draft. This reframes the dice from
random number generators into a market of opportunities with fluctuating costs
and yields, fitting the economic maneuvering of a feudal court where every
resource — land, labor, influence — is contested.

The three garden areas below the castle walls ground the game's aesthetic in
Japanese cultural practice. Gardens are not decorative in this design; they
are parallel development tracks where gardener placement yields set collection
bonuses and end-game scoring. The integration of garden cultivation, courtier
politics, and military bridge-crossing creates a triptych of feudal life —
culture, governance, and warfare — each mechanically distinct but scoring
within the same unified economy.

### Core Loop

The game is played over three rounds, each following the same structure:

1. DICE POOL SETUP — Roll a pool of dice (number scales with player count) and
   sort them by value onto three action zones of the main board: the castle
   grounds, the castle itself, and the personal domain area. Each zone contains
   multiple action spaces.

2. DICE DRAFTING (MAIN PHASE) — On each turn, a player selects one die from
   any of the three zones. The die's value determines the bonus received or the
   cost paid for the associated action. After taking the action, the player
   places the die on their personal player board, where it may activate
   additional effects or contribute to end-game scoring conditions.

   The three zones offer different action types:
   - CASTLE GROUNDS — Place gardeners in one of three gardens (left, center,
     right). The die value determines the bonus resources gained. Gardeners
     contribute to set collection and area scoring.
   - CASTLE — Place courtiers into one of the three tiers of Himeji Castle.
     Higher tiers grant more influence but require specific resources to access.
     Courtiers score based on area majority within each tier.
   - PERSONAL DOMAIN — Activate resource production, advance warriors across
     the bridge, move along the daimyo track, or gain special ability cards.
     The die value modifies the strength or cost of the action.

3. ROUND CLEANUP — Resolve bridge crossing bonuses for warriors who reached
   checkpoints. Advance the round marker. Prepare the next dice pool.

After three rounds, final scoring combines garden set collection, courtier
area majority across castle tiers, bridge advancement bonuses, daimyo track
position, and various end-game card objectives.

### Key Design Patterns

DICE VALUE AS ACTION MODIFIER: The core innovation of The White Castle is that
dice are not random — they are pre-rolled and drafted from a public pool, and
their value modifies the action's effect rather than determining success or
failure. A die showing 6 placed on a garden action grants a large resource
bonus but is expensive to draft (its cost equals its value). A die showing 1
grants a small bonus but costs almost nothing. This transforms dice from
instruments of chance into instruments of economic valuation. Every die in
the pool has a calculable cost-benefit ratio, and the drafting order determines
who gets the best deals. The design wisdom is that dice can encode graduated
value without encoding randomness — they become a pricing mechanism for a
public market of actions.

THREE GARDENS AS PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT TRACKS: The three garden areas (left,
center, right) function as independent scoring tracks that reward
specialization and breadth simultaneously. Each garden has its own set of
placement bonuses and scoring conditions, so a player who concentrates
gardeners in one garden earns deep bonuses within that track, while a player
who spreads gardeners across all three earns diversity bonuses at game end.
This creates a classic depth-versus-breadth tension that forces players to
commit early and adapt as opponents reveal their own garden strategies. The
design pattern is that parallel tracks with overlapping but distinct reward
structures prevent a single dominant strategy by making the optimal allocation
dependent on what opponents are doing.

COURTIER INFLUENCE AS AREA MAJORITY: Placing courtiers into the castle's three
tiers creates area majority contests that resolve at game end. Each tier is a
separate majority competition: the player with the most courtiers in a tier
scores the most points from that tier, with diminishing returns for second and
third place. Because courtiers require specific resources to place in higher
tiers, the area majority contest is gated by engine efficiency — you cannot
simply flood a tier without the economic infrastructure to support it. The
design insight is that area majority becomes more interesting when access to
contested regions is itself a strategic challenge, not a given.

RESOURCE CONVERSION CHAINS: The game features multiple resource types (coins,
food, iron, mother-of-pearl) that feed into different actions. Placing courtiers
requires specific resources depending on the tier. Advancing warriors requires
food. Gaining ability cards requires coins. These conversion chains mean that
raw resource acquisition is never an end in itself — it is always in service
of a specific placement or advancement goal. The chain structure prevents
resource hoarding because resources have no intrinsic end-game value; they
matter only insofar as they enable scoring actions. Players who accumulate
resources without converting them into board presence fall behind.

BRIDGE CROSSING AS WORKER ADVANCEMENT: Warriors on the bridge represent a
linear advancement track with checkpoint bonuses. Moving warriors forward
requires spending food, and reaching specific positions on the bridge grants
immediate rewards and end-game points. The bridge is a communal track where
all players' warriors coexist, creating a subtle race element — the first
player to reach a checkpoint may claim a bonus tile, incentivizing early
investment. The design pattern is that linear advancement tracks with
checkpoint rewards create natural pacing within a game that otherwise lacks
explicit round-by-round goals. The bridge gives players a persistent
investment target that spans all three rounds.

DAIMYO TRACK AS EXTERNAL SCORING PRESSURE: The daimyo track is a separate
advancement path that awards escalating end-game points based on how far a
player progresses. Advancing on the daimyo track requires specific die
placements and action choices, meaning it competes with other scoring avenues
for player attention and resources. The daimyo track functions as an external
scoring benchmark — ignoring it entirely concedes significant points to
opponents who invest in it, but over-investing in it starves the gardens,
courtiers, and bridge of resources. The design wisdom is that a single
high-value track that sits outside the main action economy creates a
gravitational pull that all players must account for, preventing complete
specialization in any one subsystem.

GARDENER PLACEMENT FOR SET COLLECTION: Gardeners placed in the three gardens
contribute to set collection objectives that score at game end. Specific
combinations of gardener types across gardens yield bonus points, creating a
puzzle that overlays the area-control and resource-management layers. The set
collection element rewards long-term planning across all three rounds —
players who draft dice solely for immediate resource gain without considering
their gardener portfolio leave end-game points on the table. The design
pattern is that set collection layered on top of action selection creates a
secondary optimization problem that rewards players who can hold both
short-term tactical and long-term strategic considerations simultaneously.

DIE PLACEMENT ON PLAYER BOARD: After drafting a die, the player places it on
their personal player board, where it may trigger additional bonuses or
contribute to personal objectives. This dual use of dice — first as action
selectors on the main board, then as permanent investments on the player
board — means that every draft decision has two dimensions. A die that is
suboptimal for its main board action might be ideal for completing a player
board pattern. The design insight is that giving a single game component two
distinct functions in sequence doubles the decision density without adding
mechanical complexity.

### What Makes It #76

The White Castle demonstrates that dice drafting can carry an entire euro game
when the dice serve as a pricing mechanism rather than a randomness engine.
By pre-rolling all dice and sorting them into public zones, Santos and Cendrero
eliminate the frustration of dice luck while preserving the tactile satisfaction
and graduated value that dice provide. The three-zone structure — gardens,
castle tiers, personal domain — creates a decision space wide enough to
support multiple viable strategies without overwhelming players at a sub-3.0
weight. The game's 80-minute runtime is unusually tight for the depth of its
interlocking scoring tracks, and the feudal Japanese theme provides a coherent
narrative frame that makes the mechanical triptych of cultivation, politics,
and military advancement feel unified rather than arbitrary. It is a
medium-weight euro that punches above its complexity class.
