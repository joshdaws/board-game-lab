### Theme Integration

Trajan is set in Rome at the height of the Roman Empire under Emperor Trajan
(98-117 AD), who presided over the empire's greatest territorial extent.
Players are Roman patricians pursuing influence across the empire's major
institutions: the Senate, the military, commerce, public works, and the
imperial administration. The game's six action areas — Seaport, Forum,
Military, Trajan Tiles, Senate, and Construction — correspond to the pillars
of Roman civic life. Feld uses the setting not as narrative but as
organizational architecture: the six domains give thematic logic to what
would otherwise be an abstract collection of scoring mechanisms. You are not
replaying Roman history; you are navigating the same multi-dimensional
optimization problem that a Roman senator would have faced — how to
accumulate influence across competing demands with limited time and
attention.

The mancala mechanism at the game's center is the boldest thematic
abstraction. Each player has a personal tray of six bowls arranged in a
circle, each corresponding to one of the six action areas. Colored markers
sit in the bowls, and on your turn you pick up all markers from one bowl,
redistribute them one-per-bowl clockwise, and take the action corresponding
to the bowl where the last marker lands. The mancala is not thematically
Roman — it is an ancient African/Asian game mechanism repurposed as a
planning puzzle. But it functions as a metaphor for administrative
scheduling: the markers represent your attention and resources, and the
redistribution models how committing to one area of governance shifts your
capacity for future decisions. The mancala does not tell a Roman story; it
creates the Roman dilemma of managing an empire too complex for any single
individual to optimize.

The quarterly cycle reinforces the Roman calendar structure. The game plays
over four quarters, each consisting of four rounds. At the end of each
quarter, citizens make demands — represented by tiles showing combinations
of bread, religion, and entertainment (the real Roman concern of panem et
circenses). If you cannot meet the current quarter's demand, you lose
victory points. This demand system prevents pure optimization by forcing
players to hedge: you cannot ignore the people's needs to pursue your
personal strategy, just as a real Roman politician ignored the populace at
their peril. The demands escalate across quarters, mirroring the increasing
difficulty of maintaining popular support in an expanding empire.

### Core Loop

The game is played over four quarters of four rounds each (16 total rounds).
Each round, players take one turn in clockwise order.

**On Your Turn:**

1. MANCALA ACTION SELECTION — Pick up all markers from one of your six
   bowls. Distribute them one-per-bowl clockwise around your personal
   tray. The bowl where the final marker lands determines your action.

2. TRAJAN TILE CHECK — If the final marker lands in a bowl adjacent to a
   Trajan tile, and the two markers at the edge of that bowl match the
   two colors shown on the Trajan tile, you claim the tile's bonus
   immediately (extra actions, VP, or special abilities). Trajan tiles
   are placed during the game and represent long-term planning objectives.

3. EXECUTE THE SELECTED ACTION (one of six):
   a) SEAPORT — Draw commodity cards from the face-up display or the deck.
      These cards form sets that can be shipped for VP at specific scoring
      moments.
   b) FORUM — Take a bonus tile from the forum display. Forum tiles grant
      immediate or endgame bonuses: extra actions, wild demand tokens, VP
      multipliers, or mancala marker manipulation.
   c) MILITARY — Move your legion on the external map to conquer provinces.
      Each conquered province grants a one-time bonus and endgame VP.
      Military movement costs one action per region moved.
   d) TRAJAN TILES — Take a Trajan tile from the supply and place it at
      the junction between two of your bowls. The tile shows two required
      marker colors and a reward. If you later end a mancala move with the
      correct colors adjacent to the tile, you claim the reward.
   e) SENATE — Advance your marker on the Senate track. The player furthest
      ahead at each quarter's end gains bonus VP. Senate position also
      provides endgame VP.
   f) CONSTRUCTION — Take a construction tile and place it on the city
      grid. Construction tiles cover specific areas and score VP based on
      adjacency and completion of rows or columns.

4. TIME MARKER ADVANCE — After your action, advance the shared time marker
   one space on the quarter track.

**Quarter End (after every 4 rounds):**

1. CITIZEN DEMANDS — Reveal the quarter's demand tile showing required
   combinations of bread, religion, and entertainment icons. Each player
   must discard matching demand tokens or lose VP (increasingly harsh
   penalties in later quarters).
2. SEAPORT SCORING — Players may ship commodity card sets for VP.
3. SENATE SCORING — Player with highest Senate position gains bonus VP.
4. Reset for next quarter.

**End Game (after fourth quarter):** Final scoring includes: commodity
sets, military conquests, Senate position, construction tiles, remaining
Trajan tiles, and various bonus tile effects. Highest VP total wins.

### Key Design Patterns

MANCALA AS ACTION SELECTION: The mancala mechanism is Trajan's signature
contribution to game design and one of the most original action selection
systems ever implemented. Traditional action selection involves choosing
from a menu (worker placement) or a hand (card play). Feld's mancala makes
action selection a planning puzzle: your current move determines which
actions will be available on future turns based on where markers
accumulate. Moving markers from a bowl with five pieces creates a
fundamentally different set of future options than moving from a bowl with
two. Expert players plan three or four moves ahead, arranging their mancala
to set up cascading sequences of desired actions. The mancala also
naturally varies the game's rhythm — sometimes you have access to exactly
the action you want, and sometimes you must spend a turn repositioning
markers. This creates organic pacing without any external timer mechanism.

POINT SALAD AS DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: Trajan is the purest expression of what
the community calls "point salad" design — a game offering many independent
paths to victory points with no single dominant strategy. Each of the six
action areas generates VP through different mechanisms: set collection
(Seaport), bonus tiles (Forum), area control (Military), conditional
bonuses (Trajan tiles), track position (Senate), and spatial puzzles
(Construction). No single area provides enough VP to win alone; competitive
play requires pursuing three or four areas while being efficient in all of
them. The point salad approach is often criticized as lacking focus, but
Feld designs it deliberately: the strategic challenge is not "which path
to take" but "how to combine paths efficiently given the constraints of
the mancala and the demand system." The multi-path design ensures that
player interaction comes through competition for limited resources in each
area rather than through direct confrontation.

TRAJAN TILES AS CONDITIONAL OBJECTIVES: The Trajan tile mechanism adds a
layer of long-term planning on top of the mancala's short-term puzzle.
Each Trajan tile shows two specific marker colors and a reward. You place
the tile at a junction between two bowls, and it triggers when you end a
mancala move with the matching colors in position. This transforms the
mancala from a purely tactical mechanism into a strategic one — you are
not just selecting actions for this turn but arranging your markers to
trigger high-value Trajan tiles on future turns. The conditional nature
of the rewards means they are never guaranteed; opponents' actions,
demand requirements, and your own strategic shifts may force you to
alter your mancala plans. Trajan tiles reward players who can maintain
strategic consistency while adapting tactically.

CITIZEN DEMANDS AS FORCED DIVERSIFICATION: The quarterly demand system
prevents players from specializing too narrowly. Each quarter reveals a
combination of bread, religion, and entertainment that all players must
satisfy or lose VP. The penalties escalate: early quarters cost only a
few points, but the fourth quarter can cost 15+ VP for unmet demands.
Demand tokens are acquired through specific actions (Forum tiles, certain
Trajan tile rewards), meaning players must allocate some of their limited
actions to defensive preparation. The demand system serves a crucial
design function: it prevents the mancala puzzle from becoming a pure
solitaire optimization by injecting external pressure that forces
adaptation. You cannot simply optimize your personal engine; you must
respond to the shared demands that affect all players equally.

TEMPORAL PLANNING ACROSS MULTIPLE HORIZONS: Trajan demands simultaneous
planning at three time scales. The immediate horizon is the mancala: which
bowl do I pick up to get the action I need right now? The medium horizon is
the quarter: can I satisfy the upcoming citizen demand while pursuing my
strategy? The long horizon is the full game: which Trajan tiles should I
place, and what marker arrangements will trigger them over four quarters?
Few games require this kind of layered temporal reasoning. The mancala
mechanism makes the time horizons interact — a move that optimizes your
immediate action may disrupt your medium-term marker positioning, and
placing a Trajan tile commits you to a specific long-term arrangement.
This interplay between time horizons is what elevates Trajan beyond its
individual mechanisms.

LOW INTERACTION BY DESIGN: Trajan's player interaction is indirect —
competition for limited Forum tiles, military provinces, Seaport cards,
and Senate position — rather than direct confrontation. This is a
deliberate design choice, not a weakness. The mancala mechanism is so
demanding as a personal optimization puzzle that adding significant
direct interaction would overwhelm players. Feld understood that the
cognitive load of the mancala, the demand system, and the multi-track
scoring was sufficient to create engaging decisions without needing
conflict mechanics. The indirect competition is meaningful: taking a
Forum tile your opponent needs or advancing past them on the Senate
track can swing the game, but these interactions happen through parallel
optimization rather than targeted aggression.

FIXED GAME LENGTH AS DESIGN CONSTRAINT: The game lasts exactly 16 rounds
(4 quarters of 4 rounds each). No variable end condition, no acceleration.
This fixed duration is essential to the mancala's viability as a mechanism:
players can plan their entire mancala sequence because they know exactly
how many moves they have. A variable-length game would undermine the
long-term planning that Trajan tiles demand. The fixed length also makes
the demand system work — you know which quarters are coming and can
prepare accordingly. Feld chose determinism over drama, and the resulting
game rewards planning depth rather than tactical adaptability.

### What Makes It #148

Trajan is Stefan Feld's most mechanically ambitious design, and the mancala
action selection system is its enduring contribution to the medium. No other
game makes action selection itself the primary puzzle — in most games, you
choose your action and then solve the puzzle of executing it, but in Trajan,
the act of choosing is the puzzle. The mancala creates a planning depth that
scales with player experience: beginners react to whatever action their move
produces, intermediate players plan two moves ahead, and experts orchestrate
entire quarter-long sequences aimed at triggering multiple Trajan tiles.
Combined with the multi-path scoring, the demand system, and the fixed
game length, Trajan delivers a cerebral, contemplative experience that
rewards sustained concentration over creative improvisation. It is the
definitive point salad game — not because it has the most scoring paths,
but because its central mechanism makes navigating those paths genuinely
difficult.
