### Theme Integration

Praga Caput Regni — Latin for "Prague, Head of the Kingdom" — immerses
players in the 14th-century reign of Charles IV, who transformed Prague
from a regional capital into one of Europe's great cities. Players are
wealthy citizens contributing to the construction of Prague's most iconic
landmarks: the Charles Bridge, St. Vitus Cathedral, the New Town walls,
and the infrastructure of the city itself. The theme is not merely
atmospheric; it structures the game's action system. Each major action
corresponds to a historically grounded civic project — upgrading buildings
reflects urban development, constructing the wall models defensive
expansion, placing bridge tiles represents the engineering feat of
spanning the Vltava, and quarrying stone supplies the raw material that
made all construction possible. Charles IV's reign was defined by
ambitious public works funded by private wealth, and the game captures
this dynamic by making players both competitors and collective builders
of a shared city.

The action selection mechanism draws thematic weight from its physicality.
Six action tiles rotate on a crane-like mechanism on the main board,
and each tile occupies a position that determines both a side benefit
(gold, stone, or eggs — the game's three currencies) and a position on
the king's road that tracks royal favor. When you select an action tile,
you gain both the action itself and the bonus associated with its current
position, modeling how the same civic contribution might be more or less
politically advantageous depending on timing and context. The rotating
crane evokes the construction equipment of medieval building sites, and
the positional bonuses reflect the patron's calculation of when a public
gesture will earn maximum favor from the crown.

The game's multiple scoring tracks and interlocking systems model the
multifaceted nature of medieval civic ambition. Advancing on the
university track represents intellectual patronage. Contributing to the
cathedral earns spiritual and political capital. Building the wall
demonstrates commitment to collective defense. No single avenue of
contribution is sufficient — Charles IV rewarded citizens who
contributed broadly to Prague's transformation, and the game's end-game
scoring reflects this by rewarding diversified investment across multiple
civic dimensions. The interplay between personal advancement and public
works is the game's central thematic tension.

### Core Loop

The game plays over a series of rounds until a trigger condition ends
the game (determined by progress on various tracks and tile depletion).
Each player's turn consists of one main action selected from the
rotating action display.

**TURN STRUCTURE — SELECT AND EXECUTE ONE ACTION**

1. CHOOSE AN ACTION TILE — Select one of the available action tiles
   from the rotating crane mechanism. Each tile sits in a position
   that provides:
   a) A resource bonus (gold, stone, or eggs) based on the left side
      of the position
   b) A king's road advancement based on the right side of the position
   c) The specific action printed on the tile itself

2. EXECUTE THE ACTION — Perform one of six possible action types:
   a) UPGRADE A BUILDING — Place a hex tile from your supply onto the
      city grid, covering existing terrain. Upgraded buildings provide
      income, victory points, or special abilities. Placement must
      respect adjacency rules and terrain requirements. Enclosing
      spaces with your tiles triggers enclosure bonuses.
   b) BUILD THE WALL — Place a wall section on the New Town wall
      track, advancing along the perimeter. Wall sections score based
      on position and adjacency to towers. Building near tower
      positions earns bonus actions or resources.
   c) PLACE A BRIDGE TILE — Add a section to the Charles Bridge by
      placing a tile onto the bridge track. Bridge tiles score based
      on their position (earlier positions score less but are easier
      to claim) and trigger bonuses when specific bridge sections
      are completed.
   d) QUARRY STONE — Collect stone resources and potentially advance
      on secondary tracks. Stone is the primary construction currency
      needed for wall and bridge building.
   e) GAIN TECHNOLOGY — Advance on the university track, unlocking
      permanent abilities and end-game scoring opportunities. Higher
      university positions provide increasingly powerful bonuses.
   f) PRODUCTION — Collect resources based on your current
      infrastructure. Upgraded buildings with production icons
      generate their outputs.

3. ADVANCE ON THE KING'S ROAD — Move your marker forward based on
   the position bonus from the selected action tile. Reaching
   checkpoints on the king's road triggers bonus actions, resources,
   or scoring opportunities.

4. RESOLVE TRIGGERED BONUSES — Many actions trigger chain effects:
   a) Enclosure bonuses when surrounding empty hexes on the city grid
   b) Bridge completion bonuses
   c) Wall tower bonuses
   d) King's road checkpoint rewards
   e) Track advancement thresholds

5. REFILL THE ACTION DISPLAY — The selected tile is removed and
   remaining tiles shift, then a new tile is drawn. The crane
   rotates, changing the positional bonuses for all remaining tiles.

**CATHEDRAL SCORING (Periodic)**

When cathedral scoring is triggered, players score based on their
contributions to various public works. Cathedral tiles are claimed
through specific actions and provide end-game multipliers.

**End Game**: Triggered when sufficient progress has been made across
the game's various tracks and tile supplies. Final scoring adds
end-game bonuses from civilization markers, cathedral tiles,
university track position, completed sets, and remaining resources
(at conversion rates). Highest total score wins.

### Key Design Patterns

ROTATING ACTION DISPLAY AS CONTEXTUAL VALUATION: The crane mechanism
is Praga's signature innovation. Six action tiles occupy positions on
a rotating display, and each position provides a different combination
of resource bonus and king's road advancement. The same action tile
becomes more or less valuable depending on where it sits in the
rotation. This means timing your action selection is as important as
choosing the right action type — the optimal moment to build a wall
section is when the wall action tile sits in a position offering the
bonus you most need. The rotating display ensures that no action is
permanently cheap or expensive; values shift each turn as tiles are
selected and the display rotates. This mechanism prevents dominant
strategies by making the metagame about reading positional context
rather than memorizing fixed valuations.

ACTION DRAFTING WITH OPPORTUNITY COST: When you select an action tile,
you remove it from the display, changing what subsequent players can
choose. This creates a drafting dynamic layered on top of action
selection. Sometimes the optimal play is not to take the best action
for yourself but to deny a critical action-position combination to an
opponent. The drafting element means that turn order matters
significantly — earlier players have more options but also bear the
responsibility of shaping the remaining landscape for later players.
This mechanism transforms what could be a multiplayer solitaire
optimization into a competitive reading game.

MULTIPLE PARALLEL TRACKS AS STRATEGIC DIVERSIFICATION: Praga features
several scoring tracks — the king's road, university track, wall
progress, bridge progress, and city grid development. Each track
provides both immediate benefits and end-game scoring potential.
The game rewards balanced investment across tracks rather than
deep specialization in one, because the marginal returns on each
track diminish while cross-track synergies increase. This multi-track
structure creates a constant optimization puzzle: with limited actions,
which combination of track advancements maximizes total output? The
parallel tracks also ensure that players feel productive every turn —
even if your preferred action is unavailable, advancing on a secondary
track still contributes to your overall position.

ENCLOSURE BONUSES AS SPATIAL INCENTIVE: When a player's hex tiles
completely surround an empty space on the city grid, they trigger an
enclosure bonus. This mechanism rewards spatial planning and creates
a secondary puzzle layer on top of the basic tile placement. Players
must think several turns ahead about how their placements will create
or block enclosure opportunities. The enclosure mechanism also creates
interaction on the shared city grid — one player's tile might
inadvertently complete an opponent's enclosure, or strategically block
it. The generalizable design principle is that spatial bonuses for
surrounding or completing areas add planning depth to tile placement
without additional rules complexity.

KING'S ROAD AS UNIFIED PROGRESS TRACKER: The king's road serves as
a meta-track that aggregates progress across all actions. Every action
tile provides some king's road advancement, but the amount varies by
position in the rotating display. The road functions as both a
competitive race (players further ahead gain first access to checkpoint
bonuses) and a pacing mechanism (checkpoints distribute resources and
bonuses at predictable intervals). By tying all actions to a single
unified progress track, the game creates a legible measure of overall
standing that helps players assess their relative positions without
computing complex multi-track comparisons.

CASCADING BONUS CHAINS: Praga is designed so that completing one
objective frequently triggers bonuses that advance other objectives.
Building a wall section might earn stone, which enables a building
upgrade, which completes an enclosure, which advances the king's road.
These cascading chains create satisfying "combo" turns where a single
action selection ripples into multiple advances. The chain structure
rewards forward planning — experienced players set up positions where
a single action triggers three or four bonuses — and provides the
dopamine hit of exceeding expectations that keeps players engaged
through the game's substantial playtime.

END-GAME MULTIPLIERS AS STRATEGIC COMMITMENT: Cathedral tiles and
other end-game scoring elements provide multipliers that reward
specific combinations of achievements. A cathedral tile might score
2 points per wall section built, or 3 points per university level
achieved. These multipliers are visible from the moment they are
claimed, allowing players to build coherent strategies around them.
The multiplier system creates strategic commitment — once you claim
a tile that rewards wall building, you have a strong incentive to
invest further in the wall track, creating divergent player
trajectories from a shared action space.

### What Makes It #187

Praga Caput Regni is Vladimir Suchy's most mechanically ambitious
design, and its rotating action display represents a genuine
innovation in the action selection space. The crane mechanism solves
a problem that plagues many Euro games: how do you prevent experienced
players from identifying and repeatedly executing a dominant action
sequence? By constantly shifting the contextual value of each action
through positional bonuses, the game ensures that the "best" action
changes every turn, demanding adaptability over memorization. The
multi-track structure provides enough strategic axes that different
players can pursue meaningfully different paths to victory, while the
cascading bonus system ensures that even a heavy, 150-minute game
maintains a sense of momentum and reward. At 3.73 weight, it sits
firmly in the heavy Euro category, but its interlocking systems
produce a coherence that justifies the complexity — every mechanism
serves the game's central question of how to maximize civic
contribution under the constraint of limited actions and rotating
opportunities.
