### Theme Integration

Raiders of the North Sea places players in the role of Viking chieftains assembling
crews, gathering provisions, and launching raids on settlements along the coastline.
The theme is not a veneer over abstract mechanics --- it structures the entire game
arc. The early game is spent in the village, hiring crew members and acquiring
supplies at locations like the Barracks, Silversmith, and Treasury. This phase models
the historical reality that Viking raids required extensive preparation: ships needed
provisioning, warriors needed recruiting, and silver needed accumulating before any
longship left harbor. The transition from village preparation to coastal raiding is
the game's natural dramatic arc, mirroring the seasonal rhythm of Norse raiding
parties that spent winters preparing and summers pillaging.

The three worker colors --- black, grey, and white --- map to the game's thematic
progression. Black workers represent common laborers available from the start, used
for basic village actions. Grey workers become available as raids begin, representing
experienced warriors gained through conflict. White workers appear only at the most
advanced raid locations, representing elite fighters or captured specialists. This
color hierarchy creates a natural escalation: early raids yield grey workers that
unlock access to stronger raids that yield white workers. The progression is not
just mechanical gatekeeping; it tells the story of a warband growing in strength
and reputation through successful campaigns.

The Mico's distinctive illustration style --- bold lines, exaggerated features, and
rich color palettes --- deserves mention as a design element rather than mere
decoration. The art gives Raiders an immediately recognizable visual identity that
reinforces the game's tone: serious enough to respect the Viking theme, stylized
enough to signal that this is an accessible, streamlined experience rather than
a heavy simulation. The visual design communicates mechanical weight before a single
rule is read.

### Core Loop

Each turn consists of exactly two steps, executed in fixed order:

1. PLACE A WORKER --- Take one worker from your personal supply and place it on
   an unoccupied action space. Resolve that action space's effect immediately. In
   the village, action spaces include:
   - Barracks: hire crew cards from the central display
   - Treasury/Silversmith: acquire silver
   - Provisions: gather food for raids
   - Town Hall: acquire offerings for the Valkyrie track
   - Gate House: special actions and card effects
   Each village space can hold only one worker, creating competition for locations.

2. PICK UP A WORKER --- After placing, you must pick up a different worker already
   present on any action space (your own or another player's). Resolve that space's
   action effect again. You now hold this worker in your supply for future placement.

   This means every turn generates two actions --- one from placement, one from
   pickup --- and the worker you pick up determines both what color worker you hold
   for future turns and what action gets triggered a second time.

3. RAIDING --- When a player has assembled sufficient crew members and provisions,
   they may place a worker at a raid location instead of a village space. Raid
   locations are arranged along the coastline in three tiers:
   - Harbours (require black or grey workers, lower crew/provision costs)
   - Outposts (require grey workers, moderate costs)
   - Fortresses and Monasteries (require white workers, highest costs)
   Raiding requires discarding the specified crew and provision cards, then gaining
   plunder (gold, iron, livestock) and victory points. Certain raids also advance
   the player on the Valkyrie track or the Armour track.

4. VALKYRIE TRACK --- Players advance on the Valkyrie track through offerings and
   specific raid rewards. At game end, position on the Valkyrie track provides
   substantial scoring, with diminishing returns for players who neglect it.

5. GAME END --- The game ends when all offerings are placed or all raid locations of
   a specific tier are depleted. Final scoring combines raid VP, Valkyrie position,
   set collection bonuses from crew cards, and remaining resources.

### Key Design Patterns

PLACE-ONE-TAKE-ONE AS WORKER PLACEMENT INNOVATION: Raiders' defining contribution
to game design is the place-one-take-one worker placement mechanic. Traditional
worker placement blocks spaces (Agricola, Caylus); removing a worker from a space
reopens it but gives you no benefit. In Raiders, picking up a worker is itself an
action --- you resolve the space's effect when you pick up, just as you do when you
place. This means every turn generates exactly two actions from a single decision
point: where to place and where to pick up. The mechanic eliminates the "all the
good spaces are taken" frustration of traditional worker placement because every
occupied space is a potential second action. It also creates emergent timing puzzles:
placing a worker on a strong space may be less valuable than picking up a worker
from a different strong space, and you must balance both halves of every turn. The
mechanic has been widely adopted since Raiders, appearing in Architects of the
West Kingdom and other Garphill titles, establishing it as a legitimate variant
of the worker placement genre.

COLOR-GATED PROGRESSION: The three worker colors (black, grey, white) function as
a progression system embedded within the worker placement mechanic. Black workers
can only access basic village and harbour actions. Grey workers unlock outpost
raids and certain enhanced village actions. White workers unlock fortress and
monastery raids --- the most valuable targets. Players do not purchase these
workers; they acquire them by raiding locations that contain them. The progression
is self-reinforcing: successful raids yield better workers, which unlock better
raids, which yield even better workers. This creates a snowball dynamic that is
tempered by the finite number of raid locations --- the game ends before any
player can execute an infinite escalation loop. The color-gating also creates
strategic sequencing decisions: should you rush to acquire grey workers early,
sacrificing village development, or build a stronger economic base first?

SET COLLECTION AS CREW MANAGEMENT: Crew cards serve a dual purpose. During raids,
they are discarded to meet raid requirements (specific combinations of warrior types).
At game end, remaining crew cards score based on set collection --- matched pairs,
specific character types, and completed sets provide bonus VP. This duality creates
a satisfying tension: the crew members you want to keep for scoring are the same
ones you need to spend on raids. Managing your crew roster becomes a resource
allocation puzzle where every hire is both a potential raid enabler and a potential
end-game scoring opportunity. The player who raids too aggressively depletes their
collection; the player who hoards crew members misses raid VP.

VALKYRIE TRACK AS PARALLEL SCORING AXIS: The Valkyrie track provides a secondary
scoring dimension that rewards a specific investment (offerings and certain raid
bonuses) with escalating end-game points. Players who ignore the Valkyrie track
entirely will struggle to compete on final scoring, but over-investing in
Valkyrie advancement means fewer resources for raids and crew collection. The
track creates strategic differentiation --- in any given game, some players will
pursue a Valkyrie-heavy strategy while others focus on raiding VP and set
collection, and the relative strength of each approach depends on the specific
crew cards available and the pace at which opponents deplete raid locations.

STREAMLINED DECISION SPACE: Raiders constrains the decision space more tightly
than most worker placement games. Each turn has exactly two decisions: where to
place and where to pick up. There are no multi-step action sequences, no resource
conversion chains, and no tech trees to navigate. This streamlining makes the
game accessible at weight 2.57 while preserving genuine strategic depth through
the interaction of crew management, raid timing, worker color progression, and
Valkyrie investment. The design demonstrates that meaningful decisions need not
require complex rule systems --- constraint can be a source of elegance.

RAID TIMING AS STRATEGIC PIVOT: The transition from village preparation to coastal
raiding is not a fixed event but a strategic decision. Raiding too early means
under-provisioned expeditions with less plunder. Raiding too late means opponents
claim the best locations first. The finite number of raid targets creates urgency,
but the village actions that prepare you for raids also compete with each other for
worker placement spaces. The timing of the first raid is often the game's most
consequential decision, establishing whether a player pursues an early aggression
or late efficiency strategy.

### What Makes It #132

Raiders of the North Sea earns its ranking through the elegance of a single
mechanical innovation: the place-one-take-one worker placement system. This
idea --- that removing a worker from the board is itself an action, not merely a
retrieval --- transforms worker placement from a blocking game into a flowing
one. Every occupied space is an opportunity rather than an obstacle. The game
builds a complete Viking raiding experience on top of this foundation, layering
crew management, color-gated progression, and Valkyrie investment without ever
losing the simplicity that makes the core mechanic work. At under 80 minutes
with clear iconography and The Mico's distinctive art, Raiders delivers a
thematically satisfying worker placement experience that respects the genre
while genuinely advancing it. The design's influence on subsequent Garphill
titles and the broader worker placement genre confirms that its central innovation
was not a gimmick but a genuine structural contribution to game design.
