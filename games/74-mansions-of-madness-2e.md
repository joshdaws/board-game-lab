## Design Notes

Designer: Nikki Valens. Published by Fantasy Flight Games (2016).

### Theme Integration

Mansions of Madness: Second Edition is a Lovecraftian investigation game, and its
most important design decision is making investigation — not combat — the primary
activity. Players are investigators in 1920s Arkham, entering haunted mansions,
abandoned asylums, and fog-shrouded streets to uncover mysteries that threaten
their sanity as much as their lives. The Cthulhu Mythos has been extensively mined
by board games, but Valens' treatment distinguishes itself by foregrounding the
genre's actual literary concern: the horror of knowing. Investigators piece together
clues, decode puzzles, interview witnesses, and gradually assemble a picture of
cosmic wrongness. Combat exists, but it is desperate, costly, and best avoided.
The game's emotional register is dread, not power fantasy.

The companion app — which replaced the human game master from the first edition —
serves as an invisible narrator managing the scenario's hidden state. It knows which
rooms contain what, when monsters appear, how NPCs respond to player actions, and
when the story branches based on investigator choices. This digital layer enables
a narrative density impossible in purely analog games: rooms can change between
visits, clues can be context-sensitive, and the scenario can adapt to player
progress without requiring a human adversary to track complex state. The app does
not play against the investigators; it curates their experience, which is a
fundamentally different design relationship than adversarial game mastering.

The physical components reinforce the investigative theme. Map tiles are revealed
one at a time as investigators explore, creating a fog-of-war effect. Miniatures
represent both investigators and monsters, grounding abstract threats in physical
presence. Condition cards — "Restrained," "Bleeding," "Paranoid" — accumulate on
investigator sheets, creating a visible deterioration that mirrors Lovecraft's
protagonists unraveling under the weight of forbidden knowledge. Insanity is not
a binary state but a spectrum: investigators acquire horror tokens and, if pushed
past their sanity threshold, gain an insanity condition that alters their win
condition or behavior for the remainder of the scenario. Some insanity conditions
are merely inconvenient; others make the investigator actively dangerous to the
group.

### Core Loop

Each round proceeds through two phases, with the app managing transitions and
hidden state:

1. INVESTIGATOR PHASE — Each investigator takes a turn consisting of up to two
   actions, chosen from:
   - Move (move up to 2 spaces; must resolve an evade check if leaving a
     monster's space voluntarily)
   - Explore (interact with a search token or unexplored doorway; the app reveals
     what you find — items, clues, narrative text, or new map tiles)
   - Search (look for hidden items in your current room; the app determines what
     is available based on scenario state)
   - Trade (exchange possessions with another investigator in your space)
   - Interact (use an item, operate a mechanism, or interact with a person or
     object; the app provides context-specific options)
   - Attack (make a combat check against a monster in your space using a weapon)
   - Component actions (use a special ability printed on an item, spell, or
     condition card)

   After taking two actions, the investigator may also perform any number of free
   component actions if available.

2. MYTHOS PHASE — Controlled entirely by the app. The app activates monsters
   (moving them toward investigators, attacking if adjacent), spawns new threats,
   advances the scenario timer, triggers narrative events, and may present choices
   that affect the story's direction. The app handles all monster AI, removing the
   need for a human game master to control adversaries.

Between phases, the app may present puzzles — spatial arrangements, code-breaking
challenges, or logic problems — that investigators must solve to progress. These
puzzles are generated by the app with variable difficulty and layout, contributing
to scenario replayability.

The scenario ends when investigators achieve (or fail) the scenario's objective,
which is gradually revealed through play. Initial setup provides only a premise;
the actual win condition emerges as investigators uncover clues.

### Key Design Patterns

APP AS DUNGEON MASTER: The companion app's role is the game's defining innovation
and its most important design pattern. In the first edition, one player acted as
the "Keeper," controlling monsters and managing hidden information while the other
players investigated. This created an asymmetric experience where the Keeper had a
fundamentally different game from the investigators. The second edition eliminates
the Keeper entirely, replacing them with an app that manages all hidden state,
monster behavior, puzzle generation, and narrative branching. This allows all human
players to be on the same team, transforming the game from asymmetric competition
into pure cooperative investigation. The design insight is that the game master's
role in narrative games is primarily administrative (tracking state, following
rules, managing hidden information) rather than creative, and that administration
can be automated without losing the experience of being guided through a story.
The app is not an opponent; it is an environment.

INVESTIGATION AS PRIMARY LOOP: Most dungeon-crawl games center combat and treat
exploration as the connective tissue between fights. Mansions of Madness inverts
this priority. The primary activity is exploring rooms, finding clues, reading
narrative text, solving puzzles, and piecing together what happened. Combat is
available but risky — investigators have limited health and sanity, weapons are
scarce, and monsters are dangerous enough that fighting is a calculated risk rather
than a default response. Many scenarios can be completed while avoiding most
combat entirely if investigators are clever about movement and timing. The design
lesson is that investigation-focused games require a different reward structure than
combat-focused ones: the reward for exploring is information, and information must
be genuinely useful (advancing the scenario) rather than decorative (flavor text
with no mechanical impact).

MODULAR MAP REVEALED THROUGH EXPLORATION: The game board is assembled from
interlocking map tiles, placed face-down or absent at the start and revealed as
investigators explore doorways and passages. The app instructs players which tile
to place and where, creating a physical fog-of-war that mirrors the investigators'
limited knowledge. This revelation mechanic serves multiple design functions: it
creates genuine surprise (what's behind this door?), it prevents players from
optimizing movement based on full information, and it makes each scenario feel
like a discovery even on repeated plays (because the app can vary tile placement
and contents). The design pattern is that physically assembling the game space
during play creates experiential immersion that pre-assembled boards cannot —
the act of placing a tile IS the act of opening a door.

INSANITY AS MECHANICAL CONSEQUENCE: When an investigator's horror tokens exceed
their sanity threshold, they draw an insanity condition. Some conditions are
benign restrictions (cannot trade items, must move toward the nearest monster).
Others are transformative: the investigator may receive a secret alternate win
condition that conflicts with the group's objective, effectively becoming a hidden
traitor. This spectrum — from inconvenience to betrayal — means that sanity loss
carries unpredictable stakes. Players cannot calculate the exact cost of
accumulating horror the way they can calculate hit point loss. The design wisdom
is that uncertain consequences create more dread than certain ones; when you know
exactly what a penalty costs, it becomes a transaction rather than a threat.

PUZZLE MINI-GAMES THROUGH APP INTEGRATION: The app generates interactive puzzles
that investigators must solve to progress — sliding tile puzzles, code locks,
wiring diagrams, and symbol-matching challenges. These puzzles are presented on
the device screen and manipulated through touch or click. They vary in difficulty
and layout across plays, contributing to replayability. Mechanically, puzzle
attempts cost actions, and investigators with higher intellect or lore stats get
more moves per attempt. The design pattern is that embedded mini-games break the
rhythm of the primary loop (explore, fight, read) and create moments of focused
problem-solving that contrast with the broader strategic planning. The app enables
puzzle types that would be impractical with physical components alone.

LOVECRAFTIAN HORROR AS NARRATIVE FRAMEWORK: The Cthulhu Mythos is not merely an
aesthetic wrapper — it provides structural principles that shape the game's design.
Lovecraftian horror is about the fragility of human understanding when confronted
with cosmic indifference. The game mechanizes this through sanity as a depletable
resource, through mysteries whose true nature is worse than their surface appearance,
and through scenarios that escalate from mundane investigation (a missing person, a
strange noise) to cosmic revelation (eldritch rituals, dimensional breaches). The
narrative arc of a typical scenario mirrors a Lovecraft story: normalcy, unease,
investigation, revelation, horror. The design insight is that licensed IP is most
effective when the mechanical design embodies the source material's structural
principles rather than merely referencing its imagery.

REPLAYABILITY THROUGH APP-DRIVEN VARIABILITY: Each scenario contains branching
paths, variable monster spawns, randomized item placement, and conditional
narrative events — all managed by the app. Players making different choices in the
same scenario will encounter different rooms, different clues, different puzzles,
and potentially different endings. The app can also track whether a group has
played a scenario before and adjust certain elements accordingly. This variability
addresses the fundamental replayability problem of narrative games (once you know
the story, why replay it?) by making the story itself mutable. The design lesson
is that digital-analog hybrid games can offer variability at a granularity that
purely analog games cannot achieve without enormous component counts.

SCENARIO-BASED STRUCTURE WITH EMERGENT OBJECTIVES: Scenarios begin with a premise
but deliberately withhold the victory condition. Investigators learn what they
need to accomplish by playing — following clues, triggering story events, and
gradually assembling the picture. This means the first half of a scenario is
often directionless exploration, with players spreading out to search rooms and
gather information before the objective crystallizes and the group can coordinate
toward a specific goal. The design pattern is that delayed objective revelation
creates a two-act structure (explore, then execute) that naturally varies pacing
and prevents the game from feeling like a predetermined path.

### What Makes It #74

Mansions of Madness: Second Edition demonstrated that a companion app could replace
a human game master without sacrificing narrative depth or emergent storytelling.
By removing the Keeper role, Valens solved the fundamental tension of one-vs-many
games — that one player is having a fundamentally different experience — and replaced
it with a fully cooperative investigation where all players share the same fog of
uncertainty. The app manages complexity that would be impractical in analog form
(branching narratives, variable puzzles, adaptive monster AI), while the physical
components — miniatures, map tiles, condition cards — provide the tactile presence
that pure digital games lack. It occupies a unique design space as a hybrid that
leverages the strengths of both mediums, and its success has influenced an entire
generation of app-integrated board games.
