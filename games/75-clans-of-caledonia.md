### Theme Integration

Clans of Caledonia is set in 19th-century Scotland during the transition from
agrarian subsistence to industrial export economy. Players represent rival Scottish
clans expanding across the Highlands, establishing dairy farms, sheep pastures,
grain fields, distilleries, and bakeries. The theme is not merely geographic
flavor — it encodes a specific economic narrative about vertical integration. Raw
goods (milk, wool, grain) can be sold directly on the market or refined into
processed goods (cheese, bread, whisky) that fulfill export contracts at premium
prices. This farm-to-factory pipeline is the game's economic spine, and it mirrors
the actual transformation of Scottish Highland economy during the period.

Each clan carries a unique economic identity rooted in Scottish cultural and
industrial history. Clan Buchanan has an extra export box and can obtain up to
two export contracts per turn. Clan Campbell gets increasing discounts on
processed goods factories. Clan MacDonald replaces standard workers with
versatile Fishermen who can occupy loch spaces. Clan Stewart starts with extra
merchants and earns a bonus pound each time they trade at the market. These
asymmetric abilities do not merely give mathematical bonuses — they suggest
different economic strategies that correspond to historical clan activities.
The result is that each clan feels like a distinct business with particular
competitive advantages, and players must adapt their strategy to their clan's
strengths rather than following a universal optimal path.

The Scottish Highland setting also informs the board's geography and economy.
The modular hex map features lochs, forests, and mountains that constrain
expansion patterns. Port cities along the coastline provide access to the export
market. The dynamic commodity market — where prices fluctuate as players buy and
sell — evokes the Glasgow mercantile exchanges that drove Scotland's 19th-century
economic transformation. Even the scoring system reflects the theme: end-game
scoring tiles vary by game, representing shifting market conditions and cultural
priorities that no single clan can predict or control.

### Core Loop

The game spans five rounds, each divided into four phases:

1. PREPARATION — Flip the previous round's scoring tile face-down. Refill empty
   export contract boxes. Retrieve merchants from the market board. (Skipped in
   round one.)

2. ACTION PHASE — Players take turns in order, performing exactly one action per
   turn, continuing until all players pass. There are eight possible actions:
   - Trade (buy or sell one type of good on the market; price shifts per unit)
   - Obtain an export contract (pay the current round cost to take a contract)
   - Expand (place a unit — worker, sheep, cow, field, cheese dairy, bakery, or
     distillery — on a space neighbouring or within shipping reach of your units)
   - Upgrade shipping (pay 4 pounds to extend shipping reach one level)
   - Upgrade technology (pay 10 pounds to improve worker income)
   - Hire a merchant (pay 4 pounds to add a merchant from your player board)
   - Fulfill an export contract (pay the required goods to earn rewards)
   - Pass (stop taking actions for this round; earn pass bonus money)

3. PRODUCTION — All production units simultaneously generate goods. Dairy farms
   produce milk. Sheep pastures produce wool. Grain fields produce grain.
   Processing units convert raw goods: cheese dairies convert milk to cheese,
   bakeries convert grain to bread, distilleries convert grain to whisky.
   Workers produce income (woodcutters earn 4 pounds, miners earn 6 pounds).

4. SCORING — Players earn Glory based on the current round's scoring tile
   condition.

After five rounds, final scoring combines victory points from Glory track
position, remaining basic goods (1 VP each), remaining processed goods (2 VP
each), money (1 VP per 10 pounds), fulfilled export contracts, imported goods
(hops, cotton, tobacco, sugar cane), and settlement scoring.

### Key Design Patterns

DYNAMIC MARKET AS SUPPLY-DEMAND SIMULATION: The central market board tracks
prices for six goods (wool, milk, grain, bread, cheese, and whisky). Each
good occupies a price track where the current price is indicated by a marker. When a player buys a good from the market, the price
rises. When a player sells a good to the market, the price falls. This creates
a genuine supply-demand simulation where player actions directly affect the
economic environment. A player who sells three wool to the market crashes the wool
price, making it cheap for opponents to buy — but earns immediate cash that can
fund expansion. Conversely, a player who buys grain drives up grain prices for
everyone. The design insight is that a shared, transparent, player-driven market
creates rich indirect interaction without requiring direct trade negotiations.
Every market transaction is simultaneously a personal economic decision and a
manipulation of the shared economic environment.

CLAN ASYMMETRY THROUGH UNIQUE ECONOMIC ADVANTAGES: Each of the nine clans
has a unique ability that bends one specific economic rule. Clan Buchanan can
hold two export contracts simultaneously. Clan Campbell gets increasing
discounts on processed goods factories. Clan Cunningham can convert surplus
milk into 8 pounds each. Clan Fergusson starts with three workers and advanced
shipping. These asymmetries are narrow enough that no clan dominates outright
but wide enough that they meaningfully shape strategic priorities. A Campbell
player naturally gravitates toward factory-heavy strategies producing processed
goods, while a Cunningham player prioritizes dairy production for cash flow. The design pattern is that effective asymmetry should constrain
the decision tree rather than expand it — giving each player a clear strategic
direction while leaving tactical execution open.

EXPORT CONTRACTS AS DIRECTED OBJECTIVES: Export contracts specify a combination
of goods (e.g., 2 cheese + 1 whisky) that, when fulfilled, provide immediate
victory points and often cash bonuses. Contracts are drawn from a shared face-up
market, creating competition for the most efficient contracts. The contract system
serves two design functions: it provides short-term goals that structure the
mid-game (I need to produce these specific goods), and it creates valuation
puzzles (is this contract worth pursuing given my production capacity and the
current market prices?). Contracts also interact with the dynamic market because
goods used to fulfill contracts are consumed, not sold — meaning contract
fulfillment does not crash market prices the way selling would. The design
wisdom is that directed objectives in economic games prevent analysis paralysis
by narrowing the option space to a manageable set of concrete goals.

NEIGHBORHOOD BONUSES FOR ADJACENT PLACEMENT: When a player places a production
unit adjacent to another player's unit on the hex map, both players receive a
neighborhood bonus (usually a small amount of money). This creates an incentive
to build near opponents rather than in isolation, counteracting the natural
tendency in territory-building games to spread out and avoid competition. Dense
clusters of production units generate more neighborhood bonuses, making crowded
regions economically productive despite the higher placement costs. The design
pattern is that positive-sum adjacency rewards create emergent spatial clustering
and ensure that player interaction on the map is not purely competitive —
proximity benefits everyone, even as it constrains future expansion options.

PORT TRADING AS MARKET INTERACTION: Ports along the map's coastline offer
fixed-price trading opportunities that bypass the dynamic market. A player within
shipping range of a port can sell or buy specific goods at the port's listed
price, which may be better or worse than the current market rate. Ports create
geographic incentives — clans near the coast have easier access to port trading,
while inland clans must invest in shipping upgrades to reach them. The design
insight is that fixed-price alternatives alongside a dynamic market create
arbitrage opportunities. When the market price for whisky is low, selling at a
port offering a higher fixed price is advantageous. This geographic pricing
variation adds a spatial dimension to economic calculation.

MODULAR BOARD SETUP FOR VARIABILITY: The hex-based map is assembled from modular
tiles at the start of each game, creating a different geographic landscape every
play. Mountain hexes, loch hexes, forest hexes, and plains hexes are distributed
randomly, meaning that the optimal expansion paths, port access routes, and clan
starting positions vary each game. This prevents memorized opening strategies and
forces players to evaluate the specific board state before committing to a plan.
The modular board also interacts with the clan asymmetry system — a Buchanan
player (cheap grain fields) wants a board with many field-eligible hexes near
their start, and the random setup may grant or deny that wish. The design
pattern is that modular setup creates replayability more efficiently than
scenario design because it generates combinatorial variety from a fixed set
of components.

SCORING TILES AS VARIABLE END-GAME CONDITIONS: Five scoring tiles are drawn at
the start of the game, one for each round, and all are visible from the beginning.
Each tile specifies a condition that scores points at the end of the corresponding
round (e.g., most export contracts fulfilled, most goods on the market, most
workers placed). Because all five tiles are known from setup, players can plan
their entire arc — investing early in conditions that score in later rounds and
front-loading production for conditions that score early. The visible scoring
tiles function as a shared strategic framework that all players must navigate
while pursuing their individual clan strategies. The design wisdom is that
telegraphing scoring conditions creates richer strategic planning than hidden or
random scoring, because players can optimize across the full game arc rather
than reacting to surprises.

TURN ORDER THROUGH PASS ORDER: The order in which players pass during the action
phase determines turn order for the next round — the first player to pass goes
first next round and receives the highest pass bonus. Going first matters because
it grants priority access to contracts, market prices before they shift, and
board positions before they fill. Passing early is rewarded with first-mover
advantage and bonus money but at the cost of fewer actions in the current round.
This creates a rhythmic tension between taking more actions now (but accepting
later turn order) and passing early to secure priority for the next round. The
design pattern is that pass-order-based turn order creates natural pacing and
forces players to weigh immediate actions against future positioning.

### What Makes It #75

Clans of Caledonia synthesizes proven eurogame mechanisms — dynamic markets, worker
placement, asymmetric powers, modular boards, contract fulfillment — into a design
that is more than the sum of its parts. The dynamic market is the keystone: every
decision in the game flows through it, whether you are buying resources to place
units, selling goods for income, fulfilling contracts, or simply watching opponents'
transactions shift the price landscape. The clan asymmetries ensure that no two
games follow the same strategic path, and the modular board prevents geographic
optimization from calcifying. It is a medium-weight economic game that captures the
feeling of building a vertically integrated supply chain — from raw Highland wool
to exported finished goods — within a framework elegant enough to teach in fifteen
minutes and deep enough to reward dozens of plays.
