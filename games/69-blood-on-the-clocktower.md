## Design Notes

Designer: Steven Medway. Published by The Pandemonium Institute (2022).

### Theme Integration

Blood on the Clocktower takes place in a small village plagued by a demon and
its minions, with the townsfolk desperately trying to identify and execute the
evil presence before everyone is killed. The gothic horror setting is more than
aesthetic -- it shapes every interaction at the table. Unlike sterile deduction
games where information is clinical and abstract, Clocktower wraps its
information in the language of curses, poisonings, drunkenness, and dark
whispers. When a player's ability malfunctions because they have been "poisoned"
by the demon's minion, they do not receive a token telling them their
information is unreliable -- they simply receive wrong information and must
figure out the discrepancy through social deduction. This creates genuine
paranoia, not the performed paranoia of lighter social deduction games.

The Storyteller role transforms the game from a rigid logical puzzle into a
guided dramatic experience. The Storyteller knows all hidden information and
actively manages the game's pacing, difficulty, and emotional arc. When a player
dies at night, the Storyteller chooses how to reveal it. When abilities provide
information, the Storyteller delivers it privately, often with theatrical flair.
This is a design decision with profound implications: it means the game's
quality depends partly on a human performance, making every session unique in a
way that deterministic hidden-role games cannot achieve. The Storyteller is not
playing against anyone -- they are curating an experience, more director than
competitor.

The village setting also informs the social dynamics. In a village, everyone
knows everyone, reputations matter, and accusations carry social weight. The
game's nomination and voting system mirrors a town-hall execution trial,
complete with defense speeches and public votes. Players do not simply point at
someone and eliminate them -- they must convince the group through persuasion,
evidence, and sometimes raw social pressure. The horror theme gives permission
for dramatic behavior that would feel out of place in a more restrained setting,
encouraging players to commit to their roles and invest emotionally in the
outcome.

### Core Loop

The game alternates between night phases (private information distribution) and
day phases (public discussion and execution). A full cycle proceeds as follows:

1. NIGHT PHASE - All players close their eyes. The Storyteller taps specific
   players awake based on their character abilities, in a fixed order determined
   by the current script. Awakened players silently perform their ability: the
   Empath learns how many of their neighbors are evil, the Monk protects someone
   from death, the Demon selects a kill target, the Poisoner chooses someone to
   poison. Each interaction is private -- only the Storyteller and the active
   player know what happened.
2. DAWN - The Storyteller announces who died during the night (if anyone). Dead
   players place a shroud on their character token but remain seated. They can
   still speak, argue, and participate in discussions. They retain one final
   vote that they can use at any point during the remainder of the game -- but
   only one.
3. DAY PHASE - Open discussion. Players share (or fabricate) what they learned
   at night. The Town debates who might be the Demon. Players may whisper
   privately with each other, form alliances, or confront suspected evil
   players. There is no structured turn order for discussion -- it is freeform
   social interaction moderated by the Storyteller.
4. NOMINATIONS - Any living player may nominate another player for execution.
   The nominated player may make a defense speech. All players (including dead
   players who have not yet used their final vote) vote by raising hands. If the
   vote count equals or exceeds half the number of living players AND exceeds the highest previous
   vote this day, the nomination stands as the leading candidate. Multiple
   nominations can occur in a single day.
5. EXECUTION - At the end of the day, the player with the most votes (if
   threshold was met) is executed. They die, gain their shroud, and join the
   ranks of the dead-but-still-participating. If the Demon is executed, Good
   wins. If only two players remain alive and the Demon is not among the
   executed, Evil wins.
6. CYCLE REPEATS - A new night begins. The game continues until Good executes
   the Demon or Evil reduces the living population to the final two (plus the
   Demon).

### Key Design Patterns

STORYTELLER AS GAME MASTER: The Storyteller is Clocktower's most radical design
decision and its most reusable insight. By placing a human in charge of
information distribution, pacing, and difficulty, Medway solves problems that
plague every other social deduction game. Werewolf suffers from player
elimination boredom -- the Storyteller can mitigate this by keeping the game
moving quickly. Resistance/Avalon suffers from solved strategies -- the
Storyteller can introduce misinformation through poisoning to break formulaic
play. Mafia suffers from lack of interesting night actions -- the Storyteller
manages a complex web of abilities that make every night phase meaningful. The
Storyteller is not a crutch for poor design; they are the game's primary balance
mechanism, adjusting the experience in real time based on player skill, group
size, and dramatic needs. For designers, this pattern suggests that some game
problems are best solved by a human moderator rather than additional rules.

DEATH WITHOUT ELIMINATION: Dead players in Clocktower retain full participation
rights -- they can speak, argue, accuse, and lie. Their only restriction is a
single remaining vote, which becomes a precious resource they must time
carefully. This single design decision eliminates the worst aspect of social
deduction games (sitting out for 45 minutes after an early death) while creating
a new strategic layer. Dead players may have received information before dying
that living players lack. Dead players may also be evil, using their continued
presence to spread misinformation. The dead player's final vote creates a
ticking resource management problem: spend it early to influence an important
execution, or save it for the endgame when votes are scarce. This pattern is
broadly applicable -- any game with player elimination should consider how dead
players can remain engaged.

POISONING AND DRUNKENNESS AS INFORMATION CORRUPTION: The Poisoner (evil team)
can choose one player each night to "poison," causing that player's ability to
malfunction. A poisoned Empath receives incorrect information. A poisoned Monk
fails to protect their target. Crucially, the poisoned player does not know they
are poisoned. Drunkenness works identically but is applied by the Storyteller
based on character selection rules. This mechanic transforms the game from a
deterministic logic puzzle into a probabilistic one. Players can never fully
trust their own information, which shifts the game's skill requirement from pure
logical deduction to a blend of deduction and social reading. If someone claims
they are the Empath and their information contradicts established facts, are
they lying about their role, or were they poisoned? This ambiguity is the engine
that drives the game's best moments.

CHARACTER ABILITY VARIETY AS DEDUCTION PUZZLE: Each script (scenario) includes a
specific set of character abilities, and the combination creates a unique
deduction puzzle. The Washerwoman learns one piece of information about another
player's identity. The Investigator learns a different kind of information. The
Chef counts evil neighbors. No two characters produce the same type of evidence,
so the Town must collate multiple incomplete, potentially corrupted information
streams into a coherent theory. The variety also means that evil players must
bluff convincingly as a specific character, and experienced players can test
bluffs by cross-referencing claimed abilities with observed game state. This
creates a meta-game where knowledge of the character set matters as much as
social intuition.

NIGHT PHASE AS PRIVATE INFORMATION DISTRIBUTION: The night phase is a precisely
choreographed sequence of private interactions between the Storyteller and
individual players. This one-to-one information channel means that no player can
fully verify another player's claims about what happened at night. You can claim
to be the Fortune Teller who checked two players and learned one is the Demon,
but only you and the Storyteller know if that is true. The private channel also
enables the Storyteller to manage information flow -- they decide exactly what
poisoned or drunk players learn, and this decision shapes the game's difficulty.
A generous Storyteller might give a poisoned player plausible (but wrong)
information; a challenging Storyteller might give them wildly inconsistent data
that a sharp player could detect.

THREE SCRIPTS AS DIFFICULTY TIERS: Clocktower ships with three scripts (Trouble
Brewing, Sects & Violets, Bad Moon Rising), each designed for increasing player
experience. Trouble Brewing uses straightforward characters with clear
information patterns -- ideal for teaching groups. Sects & Violets introduces
madness, confusion, and characters that fundamentally alter the information
landscape. Bad Moon Rising shifts focus toward protection and healing, with a
Demon whose kills are harder to prevent. This tiered approach solves the
onboarding problem that kills many complex social deduction games: new players
are not thrown into the deep end, and experienced players have a progression
path. For designers, this demonstrates that difficulty scaling can be achieved
through content curation (which characters are available) rather than rule
changes.

THE DEMON BLUFF MECHANIC: During setup, the Demon learns three good character
tokens that are NOT in play. These are the "demon bluffs" -- characters that evil
players can safely claim to be, knowing that no one at the table actually holds
that role. This single piece of information dramatically improves the evil
team's ability to bluff and creates a strategic meta-layer where good players
try to identify claims that are suspiciously uncontested. If someone claims to
be the Librarian and no one contradicts them, it might mean they are telling the
truth -- or it might mean the Librarian is one of the demon bluffs. This
mechanic ensures that the evil team always has a viable deception strategy,
preventing games from degenerating into "evil players have no plausible cover."

SCALABILITY THROUGH MODULAR CHARACTERS: Clocktower scales from 5 to 20 players
by adjusting the number and type of characters in play. More players mean more
characters, which means more information sources, more potential corruption, and
more complex social dynamics. The Storyteller selects characters before the game
based on player count and experience level, giving them control over the
session's complexity. This modular approach means the game is fundamentally
different at 7 players versus 15 players -- not just longer, but structurally
different in how information propagates and how social alliances form. The
design insight is that social games should scale qualitatively, not just
quantitatively.

### What Makes It #69

Blood on the Clocktower is the most ambitious social deduction game ever
designed, and its ambition is justified by its execution. The Storyteller role
transforms what could be a rigid hidden-role exercise into a living dramatic
experience where no two sessions feel the same. The dead-player participation
rule eliminates the genre's worst problem while creating new strategic
dimensions. The poisoning mechanic ensures that even perfect logical play cannot
guarantee certainty, keeping the game's focus on the social and intuitive skills
that make the genre compelling. And the three-script difficulty system makes the
game accessible to new players while providing a deep progression for veterans.
Where most social deduction games feel like puzzles to be solved, Clocktower
feels like a story being written collaboratively by everyone at the table --
including the dead.
