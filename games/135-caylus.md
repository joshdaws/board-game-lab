### Theme Integration

Caylus places players in 1289 France, where King Philip the Fair has ordered the
construction of a castle in the town of Caylus. Players are master builders
competing to contribute the most to the castle's construction while developing
the town's infrastructure along a road leading to the castle gates. The theme is
not a gloss over abstract mechanics --- it structures the game's fundamental
spatial logic. The road is a physical axis along which buildings are arranged in
the order they are constructed, and the Provost --- a royal official who
determines which buildings activate each round --- moves along this road,
creating a geographic cutoff that gives the spatial arrangement genuine mechanical
consequence. Buildings behind the Provost activate; buildings ahead of it do not.
The theme of royal authority constraining commercial activity is directly modeled
by this mechanism: the crown's representative decides where productive activity
occurs, and currying favor with the Provost is as important as constructing
efficient buildings.

The castle construction itself serves as a thematic and mechanical focal point.
Contributing resources to the castle earns royal favors --- bonuses chosen from
a structured hierarchy that grows more valuable as the castle nears completion.
The thematic logic is sound: the king rewards those who contribute most to his
project, and the rewards reflect the progression of royal patronage from minor
privileges to significant political power. The castle also functions as a timer ---
when specific sections of the castle are completed, the game advances toward its
conclusion, meaning that players collectively control the game's length through
their construction decisions. A player base focused on the castle accelerates the
game; one focused on town development slows it.

The town-building element models medieval economic development with surprising
fidelity. Early buildings along the road provide basic resources (wood, stone,
food). Later buildings, constructed further from the castle, offer increasingly
sophisticated services (conversion of resources, income generation, special
abilities). The physical arrangement of the road creates a narrative of
technological progression --- the town grows outward, becoming more complex as
players invest in its infrastructure. Building ownership matters: when another
player uses your building, you receive income, modeling the medieval reality
that infrastructure owners profited from others' economic activity.

### Core Loop

The game plays over an indeterminate number of rounds (typically 15-20) until
the castle is fully constructed. Each round follows a fixed sequence:

1. INCOME PHASE --- Each player receives a base income of coins. Additional income
   is earned from buildings you own that other players have used in previous rounds.
   Residences (special buildings) provide guaranteed income regardless of use.

2. WORKER PLACEMENT PHASE --- Starting with the first player and proceeding in turn
   order, players take turns either placing one worker on an available building
   space along the road or passing. Each building can hold only one worker. Workers
   require a coin payment to place. Players may also place workers on special
   fixed locations:
   - The Castle: Contribute resources to castle construction for royal favors
   - The Gate: Adjust the Provost's position
   - Specific fixed buildings: Merchant, stable, guild, and others providing
     special actions

   The PASS mechanism is critical: when you pass, you are done placing workers for
   the round. The first player to pass becomes the new first player for the next
   round. This creates a tension between placing more workers (more actions but
   more cost, later turn order) and passing early (fewer actions but guaranteed
   first player position and potential savings).

3. PROVOST ADJUSTMENT PHASE --- After all workers are placed, players may spend
   coins to shift the Provost's position along the road. Each coin moves the
   Provost one space in either direction. Players take turns adjusting. The
   Provost's final position determines which buildings activate: only buildings
   at or behind the Provost's position resolve their effects. Buildings ahead
   of the Provost are skipped, and workers placed there are wasted.

4. BUILDING ACTIVATION PHASE --- Starting from the beginning of the road and
   proceeding toward the castle, each building at or behind the Provost activates.
   The player whose worker occupies the building takes its action (collect
   resources, convert resources, gain coins, build new buildings, etc.). The
   building's owner (if different from the active player) receives one coin as
   rental income.

5. CASTLE CONSTRUCTION PHASE --- Players who placed workers at the castle may
   now contribute resources (combinations of wood, stone, food, gold, and cloth).
   Each contribution earns a royal favor: the contributing player selects one
   bonus from the available tier (victory points, resources, building upgrades,
   or income improvements). The castle has multiple sections that fill as players
   contribute, advancing the game's timer.

6. END OF ROUND --- Retrieve all workers. Advance the round marker. If the castle
   is fully constructed, proceed to final scoring. Otherwise, begin a new round.

### Key Design Patterns

THE PROVOST AS ECONOMIC COERCION: The Provost mechanism is Caylus's most important
and most imitated design innovation. The Provost is a marker on the road that
determines which buildings activate. After workers are placed but before buildings
resolve, players bid coins to move the Provost forward or backward. Moving the
Provost backward cuts off buildings beyond it, stranding opponents' workers and
wasting their investments. Moving the Provost forward ensures that buildings
further along the road activate. This mechanism transforms worker placement from
a purely constructive activity into a coercive one --- you can threaten to
deactivate opponents' placements, forcing them to spend coins defensively to
keep the Provost in a favorable position. The Provost creates negotiation-like
dynamics without explicit negotiation: the bidding is sequential and public,
generating implicit threats and alliances based on who benefits from the Provost's
position. It is the primary mechanism that distinguishes Caylus from the many
worker placement games that followed it.

BUILDING OWNERSHIP AS PASSIVE INCOME: When a player constructs a building in
Caylus, they place it on the road and retain ownership of it for the remainder
of the game. Whenever another player places a worker on that building, the owner
receives one coin of income. This ownership mechanic creates a secondary economic
layer where constructing popular buildings generates ongoing returns. The design
insight is that building infrastructure benefits you even when you are not directly
using it, modeling a rent-seeking economy. Players must evaluate buildings not
only by their action value but by their likely usage frequency --- a building that
opponents will want to use repeatedly is worth more than a powerful building that
only you would use. Ownership also creates strategic tension in the placement
phase: using an opponent's building makes their engine stronger, but the
alternative may be a weaker action on your own building.

PASS ORDER AS TURN ORDER AUCTION: The decision of when to pass during the worker
placement phase doubles as a turn order auction. The first player to pass becomes
first player in the next round --- a significant advantage in worker placement
games where prime spaces are contested. But passing early means placing fewer
workers and executing fewer actions. The pass mechanism creates a multi-layered
tradeoff: each additional worker you place costs a coin, occupies a building
that may or may not activate (depending on the Provost), and delays your claim
to first player status. Late in a round, the decision to place one more worker
versus passing carries enormous weight, as the marginal value of an additional
action must be weighed against turn order, coin conservation, and Provost risk.

CASTLE FAVORS AS STRUCTURED REWARDS: The castle functions as a shared construction
project where players contribute resources to earn royal favors from a tiered
reward menu. Each tier offers choices --- victory points, resources, building
upgrades, or income improvements --- and higher tiers (available as more castle
sections are completed) offer more powerful options. The structured reward system
forces players to evaluate which favor best complements their current strategy.
A player building an engine wants income improvements; a player approaching end
game wants raw victory points. The castle also serves as the game's timer,
meaning that contributing to the castle accelerates the game's conclusion ---
creating a tension between earning favors (which help you) and advancing the
timer (which may help opponents more if they are ahead).

WORKER PLACEMENT AS GENRE FOUNDATION: Caylus is historically significant as one
of the first games to codify the worker placement mechanism that would come to
define an entire genre. While Keydom (1998) and Bus (1999) used similar ideas
earlier, Caylus's 2005 release crystallized the template: place a worker on a
space to claim its action, spaces accommodate limited workers, and all workers
are retrieved at round's end. The genre's entire subsequent development ---
Agricola's feeding pressure, Caverna's room selection, Viticulture's seasonal
timing --- can be understood as variations on Caylus's foundational structure.
The game's historical importance is inseparable from its design merit.

ROAD AS SPATIAL ECONOMY: The linear arrangement of buildings along a road creates
a spatial dimension to the economic system. Buildings constructed earlier (closer
to the start of the road) are safer --- more likely to fall within the Provost's
activation range. Buildings constructed later (further along the road) may be more
powerful but are more vulnerable to Provost manipulation. The road also creates
a visible timeline of the town's development, with basic resource buildings near
the beginning and advanced conversion buildings near the end. This spatial
arrangement is not merely organizational; it interacts directly with the Provost
mechanism to create positional strategy within what is fundamentally an economic
game.

RESOURCE CONVERSION HIERARCHY: The game's resource system follows a clear
hierarchy: basic resources (wood, food, stone) are collected from early buildings,
then converted through later buildings into advanced resources (gold, cloth) or
directly into victory points. The conversion chain creates natural early-game
and late-game strategies: early investment in basic resource production enables
late-game conversion efficiency. Players who skip the conversion chain and focus
on castle construction pursue a different path that trades engine efficiency for
direct scoring. The hierarchy ensures that every resource decision connects to
a longer-term strategic plan.

### What Makes It #135

Caylus holds its ranking through a combination of historical significance and
enduring design quality. As one of the foundational worker placement games, its
influence on the genre is difficult to overstate --- the template it established
in 2005 still defines how designers think about action selection through worker
commitment. But historical importance alone does not sustain a ranking two
decades later. Caylus endures because the Provost mechanism creates a form of
player interaction that most worker placement games lack: the ability to directly
threaten and coerce opponents' plans by manipulating which portions of the board
activate. Combined with the pass-order turn priority system, the building
ownership economy, and the castle's dual function as reward system and game
timer, Caylus produces a strategic experience at weight 3.79 that rewards long-
term planning, adaptive tactics, and social awareness in equal measure. It is
not the most accessible worker placement game, but it may be the most
architecturally complete --- every mechanism serves a structural purpose, and
removing any one of them would diminish the whole.
