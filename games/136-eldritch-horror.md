## Design Notes

Designer: Corey Konieczka & Nikki Valens. Published by Fantasy Flight Games (2013).

### Theme Integration

Eldritch Horror places players in the roles of investigators confronting a
global Lovecraftian apocalypse. Unlike its predecessor Arkham Horror (2nd
edition), which confined its cosmic dread to a single New England city, Eldritch
Horror expands the canvas to the entire world. Investigators travel from Tokyo
to Buenos Aires, from the pyramids of Egypt to the frozen wastes of Antarctica,
pursuing leads and solving mysteries before an Ancient One awakens and
devours reality. The global scale is not cosmetic --- it fundamentally reshapes
the cooperative puzzle. Resources are scarce not because the board is small but
because it is vast. An investigator in Sydney cannot assist a crisis in London
without spending precious actions on travel, and the game's encounter system
ensures that every location visited generates its own narrative thread. The
Lovecraftian theme functions as a pressure system: the world is large, your
team is small, and the cosmic threat does not wait for you to get organized.

The game's narrative engine operates through layered encounter decks. Each
continent (Americas, Europe, Asia/Australia) has a dedicated encounter deck
producing location-specific stories. City encounters, expedition encounters,
and Other World encounters create distinct narrative textures depending on where
investigators choose to focus their efforts. The Ancient One selected at game
start determines which three mystery cards must be solved and which special
encounter deck enters play, meaning the thematic arc of every game differs based
on whether you face Azathoth, Cthulhu, Yog-Sothoth, or another cosmic entity.
Conditions --- injuries, illnesses, madness, debts, dark pacts --- attach to
investigators as narrative consequences, many with hidden flip-side effects that
trigger unpredictably. A dark pact might save you now but doom you later. The
game builds its horror not through jump scares but through accumulating dread:
small compromises compounding into catastrophe.

The omen track and mythos deck create the sensation of a world spiraling toward
destruction regardless of player intervention. Each round, the omen track
advances along a cycle of comet, star, and moon symbols. When the omen matches
gates on the board, the doom track advances. Gates spawn monsters, monsters
surge across continents, and rumors demand resolution before they trigger
penalties. The investigators are not preventing a catastrophe so much as racing
against one already in motion. This thematic framing --- reactive rather than
proactive --- distinguishes Eldritch Horror from cooperative games where players
feel in control. Here, control is an illusion maintained only through
relentless effort.

### Core Loop

Each round consists of three phases, executed in fixed order:

1. ACTION PHASE --- Each investigator, in player order, performs two actions
   from the following options:
   - TRAVEL: Move to an adjacent connected space on the world map.
   - REST: Recover 1 Health and 1 Sanity.
   - TRADE: Exchange assets, artifacts, clues, or other possessions with
     an investigator on the same space.
   - PREPARE FOR TRAVEL: Acquire a train or ship ticket for faster
     future movement.
   - ACQUIRE ASSETS: Test Influence to gain item cards from the asset deck
     (reserve pool of equipment, allies, and services).
   - COMPONENT ACTION: Use an ability printed on a card, asset, condition,
     or the current mystery.

2. ENCOUNTER PHASE --- Each investigator resolves one encounter based on their
   current location. If on a city space, draw from that continent's
   encounter deck. If on a space with a gate, choose between a location
   encounter or entering the Other World (resolving an Other World
   encounter). If on an expedition space, draw an expedition encounter.
   Encounters present narrative situations resolved through skill tests
   (rolling dice equal to the relevant skill value, counting successes on
   5 or 6). Outcomes range from gaining clues, spells, and artifacts to
   suffering injuries, madness, or worse.

3. MYTHOS PHASE --- Draw a Mythos card. Resolve its effects in order:
   - Advance the omen track one step.
   - Spawn gates at locations matching the mythos card's symbol.
   - Spawn monsters at new gates.
   - If the current omen symbol matches any gate reference token on the
     board, advance the doom track one step per matching gate.
   - Resolve the card's event text (global effects, rumors, ongoing
     environmental conditions).
   - Place clue tokens on the board at locations specified by the card.
   - Monster surge: existing monsters may move or new monsters may spawn
     at active gates.

Victory requires solving three mystery cards specific to the chosen Ancient One
before the doom track reaches zero. Losing occurs when doom reaches zero and
the Ancient One awakens (some Ancient Ones allow a final battle; Azathoth
simply destroys the world), or when all investigators are eliminated.

### Key Design Patterns

MYSTERY-DRIVEN OBJECTIVE STRUCTURE: Rather than a single fixed win condition,
each Ancient One presents a unique deck of mystery cards, three of which must
be solved to win. Mysteries demand different strategic approaches --- one might
require closing gates on specific continents, another might demand collecting
a threshold of clues, a third might require defeating a specific epic monster.
This variable objective system ensures that each game presents a different
strategic puzzle even with the same Ancient One. Mysteries also pace the
narrative arc: the first mystery introduces the threat, the second escalates it,
and the third provides a climactic resolution. The mystery structure transforms
the game from a survival exercise into a detective story with cosmic stakes.

OMEN TRACK AS DOOM ENGINE: The omen track cycles through a fixed sequence of
symbols (comet, star, moon, comet-star). Each round, the track advances one
step. When the current omen matches gate reference tokens on the board, doom
advances. This creates a predictable-yet-uncontrollable pressure system.
Players can see exactly when dangerous omen alignments will occur and can
attempt to close matching gates beforehand. But gate spawning is driven by
mythos cards, which are unpredictable. The omen track makes the doom clock
feel like a ticking mechanism rather than random punishment --- you know the
danger is coming, you can calculate when, but you cannot always prevent it.
This design converts randomness into anticipatory dread.

NARRATIVE ENCOUNTER DECKS: Each continent, expedition site, and Other World
has its own encounter deck, creating hundreds of unique narrative moments tied
to specific geographic contexts. An encounter in the Amazon differs
fundamentally from one in Istanbul, not just mechanically but narratively.
This geographic specificity makes the world feel real and varied, rewarding
exploration with fresh stories. The encounter deck structure also means the
game's narrative content is effectively bottomless --- with expansions adding
hundreds more encounters, the game can be played dozens of times before
repeating a story beat. This approach solves the cooperative game problem of
narrative exhaustion without requiring legacy-style destruction of components.

CONDITION CARDS WITH HIDDEN TRIGGERS: Conditions (injuries, illnesses,
madness, dark pacts, debts) attach to investigators as consequences of
encounters and combat. Many conditions have hidden flip-side effects: the
card back describes the condition's ongoing penalty, but flipping it reveals
a triggered consequence that activates under specific circumstances. A back
injury might suddenly paralyze an investigator at a critical moment. A dark
pact might demand a terrible price when the stars align. This hidden
information within a cooperative game is unusual and powerful --- it prevents
full optimization (you cannot plan perfectly around unknown consequences) and
generates genuine surprise and narrative tension even among experienced
players who know the encounter decks well.

GLOBAL SCALE AS RESOURCE CONSTRAINT: The world map creates a fundamentally
different cooperative puzzle than location-constrained games like Pandemic.
With investigators scattered across six continents, coordination requires
explicit investment in travel. Train and ship tickets accelerate movement but
cost actions to acquire. The Trade action requires co-location, meaning
passing critical items between investigators demands meeting up on the vast
map. This spatial friction transforms the cooperative experience: players must
constantly weigh local opportunities against global needs. Should the
investigator in Shanghai pursue a local lead or spend three actions traveling
to Rome where a mystery objective awaits? The map's size makes every
positioning decision consequential and prevents the quarterbacking problem
that plagues smaller cooperative games --- the board is simply too large for
one player to optimize all positions simultaneously.

STREAMLINED SUCCESSOR DESIGN: Eldritch Horror was explicitly designed as a
more accessible version of Arkham Horror (2nd edition), which had accumulated
enormous mechanical complexity through years of expansion content. The key
streamlining decisions reveal thoughtful design priorities: replacing the
complex board of Arkham locations with a clean world map, consolidating
dozens of item decks into a single asset deck with an Influence-based
acquisition test, replacing the first-player-driven sequential turn structure
with a simultaneous action phase, and moving from individual location
stability to a global omen/doom pressure system. Each simplification removed
mechanical overhead while preserving or enhancing the Lovecraftian atmosphere
of mounting dread. The result is a game that feels narratively richer despite
being mechanically leaner.

INVESTIGATOR ASYMMETRY AS TEAM COMPOSITION: Each investigator has a unique
combination of skill values (Lore, Influence, Observation, Strength, Will),
a starting loadout of items and abilities, a personal special ability, and
varying Health and Sanity thresholds. Some investigators excel at combat
(high Strength, special combat abilities), others at acquiring assets (high
Influence), others at closing gates (high Lore). This creates a team
composition puzzle before the game even begins: a balanced team covers more
situations but lacks specialists, while a focused team excels in specific
challenges but struggles when the game demands flexibility. The high player
count (up to 8) allows large groups to field diverse teams, though
coordination challenges scale with group size.

### What Makes It #136

Eldritch Horror succeeds by making cooperative gaming feel genuinely global in
scope and genuinely narrative in texture. The mystery-driven objective system
gives each playthrough a unique strategic arc. The encounter decks provide
hundreds of narrative moments that make the world feel alive and geographically
specific. The omen track converts randomness into anticipatory dread, giving
players something to plan around even as the cosmos conspires against them. And
the condition system introduces hidden consequences into a cooperative framework,
preventing the full-information optimization that can flatten other cooperative
games. At weight 3.32, it occupies a middle ground between the accessibility of
Pandemic and the sprawling complexity of Arkham Horror, making Lovecraftian
cooperative horror available to groups who want narrative depth without
rules-lawyer overhead. Its longevity comes from the sheer volume of narrative
content and the variability of Ancient One setups, ensuring that even after
dozens of plays the game continues to surprise.
