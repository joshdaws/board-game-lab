## Design Notes

Designer: Adam Poots. Published by Kingdom Death (2015).

### Theme Integration

Kingdom Death: Monster inhabits a space that almost no other board game
occupies -- genuine horror. Not the horror of jump scares or monster closets,
but the existential dread of fragile humans struggling against incomprehensible
darkness. The game's setting, a featureless plane of stone faces where
survivors awaken with no memory and no tools, is a philosophical statement
rendered as a game state. You begin with nothing. The world offers no
explanation. The monsters are not evil -- they are ecosystems unto themselves,
indifferent to human suffering, beautiful and terrible in equal measure. The
White Lion is not a villain; it is an apex predator, and your survivors are
prey that learned to fight back.

This thematic commitment permeates every system. The settlement phase, where
players make decisions about society between hunts, transforms the game from
a tactical combat exercise into a civilization survival narrative. Do you
develop language or art? Do you adopt a principle of protecting the young or
sacrificing them? These are not flavor choices -- they unlock specific
mechanical paths that shape the campaign for dozens of sessions. The
innovation system forces players to confront the same questions that real
early civilizations faced, compressed into agonizing either/or decisions with
permanent consequences. When a survivor dies -- and they will die, often
horribly -- the loss is felt not just mechanically but narratively, because
that survivor carried gear you crafted, disorders you managed, and fighting
arts you developed over multiple sessions.

The art direction, controversial as it is, serves the theme with unflinching
commitment. The miniatures are grotesque, beautiful, and deeply strange in
equal measure. Every monster design communicates its behavior through visual
language before a single card is drawn from its AI deck. The Screaming
Antelope's distended body tells you it will charge. The King's Man's rigid
posture tells you it will punish predictability. Form follows function in
Kingdom Death's bestiary, and the result is a world that feels coherent in
its nightmare logic.

### Core Loop

A campaign spans approximately 25-30 lantern years (sessions), each following
a three-phase structure:

1. **HUNT PHASE** -- Select a quarry from available monsters. Traverse the
   hunt board by drawing hunt event cards, which create a narrative journey
   toward the showdown. Events may wound, separate, or benefit survivors
   before combat even begins. The hunt is not a formality -- it is a gauntlet
   that sets the conditions for the fight.

2. **SHOWDOWN PHASE** -- Tactical grid-based combat against the monster.
   Each round:
   a. Survivors act first, spending actions to move, attack, use items, or
      activate fighting arts
   b. Attacks target specific hit locations by drawing from the monster's
      Hit Location deck -- each body part has unique wound thresholds,
      critical wound effects, and reaction triggers
   c. The monster acts by drawing from its AI deck, which programs its
      behavior with escalating aggression
   d. Moods and special rules modify the monster's behavior as the fight
      progresses (wounded monsters become more dangerous)
   e. Combat continues until the monster is killed or all survivors are dead
      or fled

3. **SETTLEMENT PHASE** -- The heart of the campaign meta-game. Players:
   a. Return with resources harvested from the monster
   b. Trigger settlement events (often devastating story encounters)
   c. Craft gear using monster resources and settlement locations
   d. Develop innovations (technology/culture advances with branching paths)
   e. Choose departing survivors for the next hunt, equipping them from the
      settlement's gear inventory
   f. Age surviving characters, potentially gaining or losing abilities

### Key Design Patterns

SETTLEMENT AS PERSISTENT META-GAME: The settlement is the true protagonist of
Kingdom Death, not any individual survivor. Players develop a civilization over
25+ sessions, building locations that unlock crafting recipes, choosing
innovations that grant permanent abilities, and making principle decisions that
branch the campaign's narrative. This meta-layer transforms individual
showdowns from isolated tactical puzzles into chapters of a larger story. A
defeat in combat matters because it costs the settlement resources, survivors,
and momentum. A victory matters because it provides materials for gear that
will define future hunts. The design lesson is that persistent state across
sessions creates investment that no single-session game can match.

HIT LOCATION SYSTEM AS TACTICAL DEPTH: Rather than a single health pool,
each monster has a deck of hit location cards representing body parts -- limbs,
torso, head, and unique anatomy. When a survivor attacks, they draw from this
deck and must meet the location's toughness threshold to wound. Each location
has unique critical wound effects (severing a limb might reduce the monster's
movement), reaction triggers (hitting the chest might cause a counterattack),
and persistent injury states. This system creates immense tactical texture
because players must weigh the risk/reward of each attack knowing they cannot
fully control which location they hit. It also means every monster fight feels
distinct -- the Screaming Antelope's hit locations reward aggressive targeting
of its belly, while the Phoenix's feathered locations punish predictable
attack patterns.

AI DECK AS MONSTER BEHAVIOR PROGRAMMING: Each monster's behavior is governed
by an AI deck that determines its actions during its turn. Cards specify
movement, targeting priorities, and attack patterns. As the monster takes
damage, mood cards and wounded behavior modifications alter the deck,
creating escalation within a single fight. The AI deck is a masterful design
tool because it creates emergent monster personality without requiring a game
master. The Butcher charges relentlessly; the King's Man punishes clustering;
the Watcher manipulates space. Each monster feels like it has intent, and
players learn to read and predict AI patterns across multiple encounters with
the same quarry.

GEAR GRID AS EQUIPMENT TETRIS: Each survivor has a 3x3 gear grid where
equipment is placed. Position matters -- some items grant bonuses to adjacent
gear, some require specific grid positions, and the grid's limited space
forces painful choices about loadout optimization. The gear grid transforms
equipment selection from a simple stat comparison into a spatial puzzle. A
survivor's identity emerges from their grid configuration: a tank with heavy
armor filling the perimeter, a glass cannon with weapons stacked for maximum
attack bonuses, a support character with consumables positioned for quick
access. The grid also creates a crafting aspiration loop -- players see empty
grid spaces as goals to fill, driving the hunt-craft-equip cycle.

PERMADEATH AS EMOTIONAL STAKES: Survivors die permanently. There is no
resurrection mechanic, no save-scumming, no take-backs. When a veteran
survivor with rare fighting arts, hard-won disorders, and lovingly crafted
gear is killed by a random hunt event or a catastrophic showdown roll, the
loss is real. This design choice is the engine of Kingdom Death's emotional
power. It makes every decision feel consequential, every risk calculation
genuinely tense. The settlement must continuously produce new survivors to
replace the fallen, creating a generational narrative where knowledge and
gear are inherited but individual heroes are expendable. Permadeath works
here because the campaign is long enough for attachment to form and because
the settlement structure provides continuity beyond any single life.

HUNT PHASE AS NARRATIVE JOURNEY: The hunt is not a simple "go to the monster"
step -- it is a procedurally generated story. Players draw hunt event cards
that create encounters, hazards, and opportunities on the path to the
showdown. A hunt might separate the party, wound a survivor before combat,
offer a mysterious stranger's bargain, or reveal something about the world's
lore. The hunt phase serves multiple design purposes: it builds tension before
the showdown, it creates resource attrition that makes combat harder, it
delivers narrative content without requiring a campaign book, and it makes
the journey to the monster feel like an expedition rather than a menu
selection.

INNOVATION AND PRINCIPLE BRANCHING: At key moments, the settlement must choose
between paired innovations or principles -- Language or Drums, Protect the
Young or Survival of the Fittest, Graves or Cannibalize. Each choice
permanently locks the settlement into a mechanical path with cascading
consequences. These binary forks create massive campaign variability and
ensure that no two settlements follow the same trajectory. The design
pattern is that meaningful permanence creates both replayability (try the
other path next campaign) and narrative weight (this is who your civilization
chose to become).

ART-HORROR AESTHETIC AS DESIGN IDENTITY: Kingdom Death's visual language --
the grotesque miniatures, the disturbing settlement events, the body horror
of monster anatomy -- is not gratuitous. It is a deliberate design choice
that creates a tonal consistency no other game achieves. The aesthetic
filters the audience: players who engage with Kingdom Death are self-selected
for tolerance of its darkness, which means the table's social contract is
pre-negotiated by the game's identity. This allows the design to go places
that a tonally neutral game could not -- genuine despair, pyrrhic victories,
and the horror of survival at any cost.

RESOURCE SCARCITY AS DECISION PRESSURE: Every resource in Kingdom Death is
limited and meaningful. Monster parts are finite and consumed by crafting.
Survival points (a meta-currency for dodging, encouraging, and activating
abilities) are scarce and do not regenerate easily. Endeavor tokens limit
settlement actions per year. The economy is deliberately tight, ensuring
that every crafting decision, every settlement action, and every survival
point expenditure carries real opportunity cost. Abundance would undermine
the horror -- scarcity IS the horror.

### What Makes It #92

Kingdom Death: Monster is not a game for everyone, and that exclusivity is
precisely what makes it remarkable. It is the most ambitious campaign board
game ever produced -- a 25+ session narrative where a civilization of fragile
humans claws its way upward against incomprehensible monsters, making
permanent choices that shape their society's identity, crafting gear from
the bodies of their enemies, and losing beloved survivors to a world that
is indifferent to their suffering. No other game achieves this combination
of tactical combat depth, persistent civilization management, emergent
narrative, and emotional stakes. The hit location system alone would make it
noteworthy; the settlement meta-game would make it memorable; together, wrapped
in Adam Poots' uncompromising vision, they make it unforgettable.
