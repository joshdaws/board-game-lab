### Theme Integration

Lorenzo il Magnifico is set in Renaissance Florence, where noble families
compete for cultural and political supremacy by acquiring development cards
representing territories, buildings, characters, and ventures. Players lead
their families through the era of the Medici, investing in economic
infrastructure, cultivating relationships with powerful figures, and navigating
the demands of the Catholic Church. The Renaissance theme is not merely scenic;
it structures the game's central tension between secular ambition and religious
obligation. The excommunication mechanic --- where players who fail to maintain
sufficient faith on the Church support track are punished with permanent
penalties --- models the genuine historical pressure that even the most powerful
Italian families faced from papal authority. You can ignore the Church, but the
cost is steep and cumulative.

The four types of development cards map to recognizable aspects of Renaissance
society. Territory cards represent land holdings that generate resources through
harvest actions. Building cards represent workshops and production facilities
that convert raw resources into goods or victory points through production
actions. Character cards represent influential figures --- scholars, merchants,
artisans, and clergy --- who provide ongoing abilities and end-game bonuses.
Venture cards represent speculative enterprises that cost various resources
upfront but score heavily at game end based on collected sets and conditions.
This four-card taxonomy creates a natural strategic language: a territory-heavy
strategy builds a resource engine, a building-focused approach processes those
resources, a character strategy emphasizes ongoing abilities and flexibility,
and a venture approach gambles on end-game scoring. The card types are not
siloed; they interact through production chains and mutual dependencies,
modeling the interconnected economic reality of Renaissance commerce.

The three colored dice --- orange, black, and white --- rolled publicly at the
start of each round represent the unpredictable political and economic currents
of the era. All players share the same dice values, but each player has four
family members (one colored to match each die, plus a neutral member with
fixed value zero) whose effectiveness is determined by the corresponding die.
When the orange die rolls high, everyone's orange family member is powerful;
when it rolls low, everyone must adapt. This shared-constraint system models
the idea that external forces (papal edicts, market shifts, political
upheavals) affect all noble families simultaneously, and success comes from
adapting to circumstances rather than controlling them.

### Core Loop

The game plays over six rounds (three per period, two periods total). Each
round follows this structure:

1. DICE ROLL --- Three colored dice (orange, black, white) are rolled and
   placed on the round order board. These values apply to ALL players'
   corresponding family members for the entire round.

2. PLAYER TURNS --- In turn order, each player places one family member at
   a time on an available action space. Each family member's base strength
   equals the value of their corresponding die (the neutral family member
   always has value zero). Players may spend servants (a resource) to boost
   a family member's value by 1 per servant spent. Action spaces include:
   - TOWER FLOORS (four towers of four floors each): Acquire a development
     card (territory, building, character, or venture) from the corresponding
     tower floor. Higher floors require higher family member strength. If
     another player already occupies any floor of that tower, you must pay
     3 coins as a penalty. The first player to place in each tower receives
     a tower bonus (resources or privileges).
   - HARVEST: Activate all territory card effects, generating resources
     based on combined territory production values (requires meeting a
     strength threshold).
   - PRODUCTION: Activate all building card effects, converting resources
     into goods, points, or military strength (requires meeting a
     strength threshold).
   - MARKET: Gain specific resource combinations (coins, servants,
     military points, or council privileges).
   - COUNCIL PALACE: Gain a council privilege and move to first position
     in turn order for the next round.

3. CHURCH SUPPORT CHECK (end of each period, rounds 3 and 6): Each player
   must meet a faith threshold on the Church support track. Players who
   meet the threshold gain a permanent bonus tile. Players who fail to meet
   it suffer an excommunication --- a permanent penalty tile that handicaps
   them for the remainder of the game. Excommunications compound across
   periods, so failing twice is devastating.

4. END OF ROUND --- Reset the board, refill tower card slots for the next
   round with new development cards from the appropriate period deck.

After six rounds, final scoring: territory and character end-game bonuses,
venture card scoring based on conditions met, military track rewards, faith
track position, and remaining resources converted to points.

### Key Design Patterns

SHARED DICE AS PUBLIC CONSTRAINT: The game's signature innovation is that the
three colored dice, rolled once per round, determine the base strength of
every player's corresponding family members simultaneously. There are no
private dice, no individual rolls, no hidden information in worker strength.
When the white die shows 6, every player's white family member operates at
strength 6. When it shows 1, everyone scrambles. This design eliminates
luck-of-the-roll frustration because all players face identical constraints.
Strategic differentiation comes not from who rolled better but from who
adapts better: spending servants to boost weak family members, choosing action
spaces where low strength suffices, or investing in leader cards that modify
die values. The shared-dice system creates a unique optimization puzzle each
round where all players solve the same problem with different card tableaux,
resource positions, and strategic priorities.

EXCOMMUNICATION AS STRATEGIC SACRIFICE: At the end of each period, players
who have not accumulated enough faith points face excommunication --- a
permanent penalty affecting their abilities for the rest of the game. First-
period excommunications are relatively mild (reduced resource income, weaker
harvests). Second-period excommunications are severe (lost end-game scoring
categories, permanent action penalties). Third-period excommunications strip
victory points directly. The genius of this system is that excommunication is
sometimes strategically correct. The resources spent maintaining Church support
could have been invested in development cards or military strength. An
experienced player might deliberately accept a mild first-period
excommunication to accelerate their engine, planning to avoid the devastating
later ones. This creates a genuine strategic dilemma rather than a simple
penalty to avoid, and it generates player differentiation as different
strategies accept different levels of Church compliance.

TOWER OCCUPATION TAX: When placing a family member on a tower floor that
already has another player's family member anywhere in that same tower, the
incoming player must pay a 3-coin tax. This elegantly simple rule creates
substantial interaction in what might otherwise be a purely parallel
optimization game. It incentivizes being the first player into a tower each
round (avoiding the tax), punishes players who follow popular towers (paying
3 coins repeatedly adds up), and creates a timing game around when to commit
to contested towers versus uncontested ones. The tax is not prohibitive ---
3 coins is painful but affordable --- so it functions as a friction cost
rather than a hard block, ensuring that no development card is ever truly
inaccessible while making competition for popular cards meaningfully expensive.

SERVANT ECONOMY AS FLEXIBILITY CURRENCY: Servants function as the game's
universal flexibility resource. They can boost any family member's strength
by 1 per servant spent, converting a weak die roll into a viable action. They
can be accumulated, traded at the market, or generated through card effects.
The servant economy creates a meta-layer of resource management: players who
invest in servant generation can partially neutralize bad die rolls, access
higher tower floors despite low dice, and meet harvest/production thresholds
more consistently. But servants spent on boosting are servants not available
for other purposes, and the opportunity cost of acquiring them (market spaces,
card abilities) diverts from other strategic investments. Servants are the
lubricant that keeps the shared-dice system from feeling punitive without
eliminating the constraint entirely.

LEADER CARDS AS ASYMMETRIC ENGINES: Leader cards, acquired through specific
development cards or achievements, provide powerful ongoing abilities that
differentiate player strategies. Some leaders modify die values (adding +1
to all family members, or treating one die as always showing a specific value).
Others reduce costs, provide bonus resources, or unlock alternative scoring
paths. Leaders create asymmetric starting conditions for the mid-game: once
a player acquires a leader that modifies their relationship to the dice, their
optimization puzzle diverges from other players' puzzles. The leader system
also creates a racing dynamic --- only one copy of each leader exists, so
players who prioritize leader acquisition early gain strategic options that
latecomers cannot access.

FOUR-CARD TAXONOMY AS STRATEGY SPACE: The four development card types create a
natural strategic vocabulary. Territory-heavy strategies build resource engines
fueled by the harvest action. Building-heavy strategies create conversion
chains activated by the production action. Character strategies accumulate
ongoing abilities and end-game scoring conditions. Venture strategies invest
resources upfront for conditional end-game payoffs. No strategy works in
isolation --- territories generate resources that buildings convert, characters
provide abilities that make territories and buildings more effective, and
ventures provide scoring targets that guide the other three card types'
acquisition priorities. This interdependency means players must mix card types
while emphasizing one or two, creating a wide strategic space from four
simple categories.

MILITARY TRACK AS ALTERNATIVE ECONOMY: The military track provides an
orthogonal scoring dimension that rewards investment in military strength
(earned through specific cards and actions). At game end, players are ranked
on the military track, with the top positions earning significant bonus
points. The military track creates strategic tension because military strength
is earned through specific card types and actions that compete with other
investments. A player who ignores military entirely concedes those bonus
points; a player who invests heavily diverts resources from engine building.
The track's presence ensures that no single strategy dominates, as players
must either invest in military or accept the scoring gap it creates.

### What Makes It #137

Lorenzo il Magnifico's central innovation --- shared dice determining all
players' worker strength --- creates a cooperative-competitive tension that no
other worker placement game replicates. Every round, all players solve the
same optimization problem with different resources, card tableaux, and
strategic priorities. The excommunication system introduces genuine sacrifice
decisions rather than obvious penalties. The tower occupation tax generates
player interaction through economic friction rather than direct conflict. And
the four-card taxonomy creates a strategic space wide enough to support
repeated play without prescribing dominant strategies. At weight 3.29, it
occupies a Euro-game sweet spot: deep enough to reward experienced players'
engine-building skills, but structured enough that the six-round arc provides
clear pacing and a definitive ending. The shared-dice mechanism remains
Lorenzo's lasting contribution to worker placement design --- proving that
public constraints can generate more interesting decisions than private ones.
