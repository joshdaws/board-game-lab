### Theme Integration

Splendor Duel reimagines the gem-trading Renaissance theme of the original
Splendor as an intimate head-to-head contest between rival guild masters of
jewelers. Where the original game presented gem acquisition as a mostly solitary
engine-building exercise that happened to involve multiple players, the duel
format transforms it into a direct confrontation. Players compete to craft the
most prestigious adornments for monarchs and powerful leaders of the Renaissance,
acquiring gems not from abstract supply piles but from a shared game board where
token placement creates spatial puzzles. The introduction of Pearls as a new
resource and Gold tokens as a scarce wild currency adds strategic texture that
the original lacked.

The card pyramid — three levels of Jewel cards arranged by cost and power —
represents the progression from apprentice craftsmanship to master artistry.
Level 1 cards provide modest bonuses and prestige; Level 3 cards offer
substantial prestige and powerful abilities. Royal cards, earned by accumulating
Crowns, represent the patronage of nobility — a thematic reward for building a
reputation through consistent excellence. The Privilege scrolls, exchanged
between players as a balancing mechanism, evoke the political maneuvering of
Renaissance guilds competing for favor. Every mechanical addition to the
Splendor formula serves to make the two-player experience feel like a genuine
rivalry rather than a parallel optimization exercise.

### Core Loop

Players alternate turns until one player triggers a victory condition. Each
turn consists of optional actions followed by one mandatory action:

1. OPTIONAL ACTIONS (in order, before the mandatory action):
   a. USE PRIVILEGES - Return one or more Privilege scrolls to take one Gem or
      Pearl token per Privilege from the board. Cannot take Gold tokens this way.
   b. REPLENISH THE BOARD - If the bag is not empty, mix tokens and refill all
      empty board spaces following the spiral pattern. The opponent receives one
      Privilege scroll as compensation.

2. MANDATORY ACTION (choose one):
   a. TAKE UP TO 3 TOKENS - Select up to 3 adjacent Gem and/or Pearl tokens
      from the board in an uninterrupted horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line.
      Cannot take Gold tokens. If you take 3 tokens of the same color or 2
      Pearls, your opponent receives a Privilege.
   b. TAKE 1 GOLD TOKEN AND RESERVE 1 JEWEL CARD - Take a Gold from the board
      (if available) and reserve a card from the pyramid or deck top. Maximum 3
      reserved cards. Gold tokens are wild for purchasing.
   c. PURCHASE 1 JEWEL CARD - Buy a card from the pyramid or your reserve by
      paying its gem cost (reduced by bonuses from previously purchased cards).
      Spent tokens return to the bag. Resolve any card ability immediately.

3. END OF TURN - If you hold more than 10 tokens, discard down to 10. Check
   victory conditions: 20+ Prestige points, 10+ Crowns, or 10+ Prestige on
   cards of a single bonus color. Crown milestones (3rd and 6th) trigger
   Royal card acquisition.

### Key Design Patterns

SPATIAL TOKEN DRAFTING: The 5x5 game board with tokens arranged in a spiral
pattern transforms resource acquisition from the original Splendor's simple
"take chips from piles" into a spatial puzzle. Tokens must be taken in adjacent
lines — horizontal, vertical, or diagonal — forcing players to read the board
state and plan token selections that serve their needs while denying opponents
optimal configurations. The spatial constraint means that even identical token
compositions have different strategic values depending on their board positions.
This single mechanical change elevates the resource-gathering phase from a
near-automatic decision into the game's primary strategic arena.

PRIVILEGE AS DYNAMIC BALANCING: The three Privilege scrolls create an elegant
catch-up and tempo-regulation mechanism. Replenishing the board (a powerful
action that restocks options) gives the opponent a Privilege. Taking 3 identical
tokens or 2 Pearls gives the opponent a Privilege. Each Privilege grants a free
token pick on a future turn. This system means that powerful actions carry a
cost paid in future opponent advantage, while weaker positions accumulate
compensatory resources. The Privilege economy prevents runaway leads and ensures
that both players have meaningful agency throughout the game, addressing a
common criticism of the original Splendor where early advantages could snowball.

TRIPLE VICTORY CONDITIONS: The three independent win conditions — 20 Prestige
points, 10 Crowns, or 10 Prestige in a single color — force both players to
monitor multiple threat vectors simultaneously. A player pursuing the Crown
path builds differently from one chasing color concentration, and both differ
from a pure Prestige approach. The triple-path design means that blocking one
opponent strategy may leave another path open, creating a constant defensive
calculus alongside offensive planning. It also ensures that games end at
different tempos and through different mechanisms, preventing strategic
stagnation across repeated plays.

CARD ABILITIES AS TEMPO ACCELERATORS: Unlike the original Splendor where cards
provided only passive bonuses, Splendor Duel's Jewel cards feature five distinct
abilities that trigger on purchase. The extra-turn ability creates burst tempo;
the token-steal ability introduces direct conflict; the color-matching ability
provides free resources; the Privilege-gain ability manipulates the balancing
economy; and the color-copy ability provides flexible engine building. These
abilities transform card evaluation from simple cost-benefit analysis into a
multi-dimensional assessment where timing, board state, and opponent position
all influence a card's true value.

PYRAMID DISPLAY AS INFORMATION GRADIENT: The card pyramid — 5 Level 1 cards
at the base, 4 Level 2 in the middle, 3 Level 3 at the top — creates a visual
hierarchy where cheaper cards are more abundant and expensive cards more scarce.
When a card is purchased or reserved from the pyramid, it is replaced from the
corresponding deck, maintaining the display. The pyramid structure means that
Level 3 cards (the most powerful) are always visible and plannable, while the
deeper decks create uncertainty about future options. Reserved cards add a
hidden information layer: opponents know you have a reserved card but not which
one, introducing bluffing potential around Gold token usage.

GOLD AS CONSTRAINED WILDCARD: Gold tokens are the only wild resource, usable
in place of any Gem or Pearl. But they can only be acquired through the reserve
action, which also requires taking a card from the pyramid or a deck top. This
bundling means Gold access is gated behind a specific action that also commits
a reserve slot (maximum 3). The constraint prevents Gold from becoming an
all-purpose solution and instead positions it as a strategic tool for enabling
specific high-cost purchases. Since taking Gold also denies the opponent access
to a diminishing supply, the reserve action carries both offensive and defensive
implications.

CROWNS AS SECONDARY PROGRESSION: Crown symbols on certain Jewel cards create
a secondary collection axis that gates access to Royal cards — powerful bonus
cards acquired at the 3rd and 6th Crown milestones. Royal cards are not
purchased but chosen from four available options when a milestone is reached,
providing significant Prestige, Privileges, or abilities. The Crown system
rewards players who diversify their purchases across Crown-bearing cards rather
than focusing exclusively on engine optimization, and it creates milestone
races where both players track each other's Crown accumulation. Because Crowns
also feed one of the three victory conditions (10 Crowns to win), they serve
double duty as both a milestone trigger and a strategic path, meaning Crown-rich
cards are always more valuable than their raw Prestige would suggest.

TOKEN LIMIT AS TEMPO PRESSURE: The 10-token hand limit at end of turn prevents
indefinite stockpiling and forces a cycle of acquisition and spending. Players
cannot simply hoard gems across many turns to enable a single massive purchase;
they must regularly convert tokens into cards or accept losing excess resources.
This constraint accelerates the game's pace and creates tactical pressure to
purchase cards slightly earlier than optimal rather than risk discarding valuable
tokens. Combined with the board's finite token supply (25 tokens total, only
replenished when a player spends an action), the limit ensures both players
remain in constant tension between gathering and building.

### What Makes It #112

Splendor Duel solves the fundamental problem of adapting a multiplayer engine
builder for two players: it makes the opponent matter on every single turn.
The spatial token board, the Privilege economy, the take-that card abilities,
and the triple victory conditions collectively ensure that Splendor Duel is
not solitaire-with-an-audience but a genuine duel. Andre and Cathala preserved
the satisfying engine-building arc of the original — the pleasure of watching
gem bonuses compound until expensive cards become free — while layering in
enough interaction that defensive play is as important as offensive efficiency.
At 30 minutes and a 2.17 weight, it delivers strategic depth that belies its
accessibility, making it one of the most successful two-player adaptations in
modern board gaming.
