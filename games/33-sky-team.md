## Design Notes

Designer: Luc Rémond. Published by Scorpion Masqué (2023). Winner of Spiel des Jahres 2024.

### Theme Integration

The game casts two players as Pilot and Co-Pilot attempting to land a commercial
airplane. Unlike most cooperative themes that dress up abstract systems, the
aviation theme here is load-bearing — every mechanism maps to a recognizable
cockpit function. The axis track represents the aircraft's lateral tilt. The
engine dials control approach speed. Landing gear and flaps must be deployed in
sequence before touchdown. Air traffic must be cleared from the runway via radio.
The approach track physically represents the plane descending toward the airport.
The result is a game where non-gamers immediately understand what they are doing
and why, because the metaphor never breaks. When the axis tilts too far and the
plane crashes, it feels narratively inevitable rather than mechanically arbitrary.
The communication restriction — no discussion once dice are rolled — maps to the
high-workload, low-bandwidth reality of a cockpit during critical approach phases.
Pilots in real emergencies rely on trained procedures and reading their partner's
actions, not lengthy discussion. The game replicates that pressure at a fraction
of the complexity.

### Core Loop

Each round follows a tight sequence:

1. ROLL — Both players simultaneously roll their 4 dice behind personal screens.
   Dice values are private; neither player knows what the other has available.
2. PLACE — Players alternate placing one die at a time onto shared cockpit board
   spaces. The Pilot always places first. Each space accepts one die and produces
   an effect determined by the die's value:
   - **Axis** — Pilot's die tilts left, Co-Pilot's die tilts right. Higher values
     produce more tilt. If the axis marker is beyond the safe zone at round end,
     the plane crashes.
   - **Engines** — Each engine accepts one die. Combined engine value determines
     speed on the approach track. Must match the required descent rate.
   - **Radio** — Clears airplane traffic tokens from the approach track. Higher
     die values clear more traffic.
   - **Landing Gear / Flaps** — Must be deployed before final approach. Require
     specific die values or cumulative placement.
   - **Concentration** — Allows rerolling or modifying dice. A pressure valve for
     bad rolls.
   - **Brakes** — Used during final landing to reduce speed below the threshold.
3. RESOLVE — Check axis balance (crash if off-center), advance plane on approach
   track based on engine speed, verify no traffic collision. If the plane has
   reached the runway, check all landing conditions (gear down, flaps deployed,
   speed correct). Success or crash.

Victory: the plane reaches the runway with all conditions met — gear deployed,
flaps extended, approach speed correct, axis balanced, runway clear of traffic.
Defeat: axis out of balance, traffic collision, overshoot (too fast), stall
(too slow), or failure to deploy gear/flaps before landing.

### Key Design Patterns

COMMUNICATION RESTRICTION AS TENSION ENGINE: The defining design decision in
Sky Team is forbidding verbal coordination after dice are rolled. Players see
only their own dice. They must read their partner's placements as signals —
if the Co-Pilot places a high die on their engine, the Pilot must infer whether
to match or compensate. This transforms a lightweight dice-placement puzzle into
a game of mutual prediction and trust. The restriction does not add complexity;
it removes a channel. But that removal creates the game's entire emotional arc:
the dread of not knowing, the relief when intentions align, the shared groan
when they do not. Crucially, unlike many communication-limited co-ops (Hanabi,
The Crew), the restriction here is binary and absolute — no hints, no signals,
no coded language. This makes the rule trivially enforceable and immediately
understood.

AXIS BALANCE AS FORCED INTERDEPENDENCE: The axis mechanism is the purest
expression of the game's cooperative tension. The Pilot's dice tilt left; the
Co-Pilot's dice tilt right. A high-value die from one player MUST be offset by
the other, or the plane crashes. This is not optional teamwork — it is a
mathematical constraint that forces both players to account for each other every
single round. Because axis placement happens alongside all other placements
(engines, radio, gear), players must constantly weigh their personal allocation
against the shared balance requirement. The axis is the game's handshake: a
mechanism that only works when both sides participate, and whose failure is
immediately catastrophic.

DICE AS CONSTRAINED RESOURCE ALLOCATION: Each player has exactly 4 dice per
round, and each die can be placed on exactly one cockpit space. This creates a
tight allocation puzzle: a die used to balance the axis cannot also power the
engine or clear traffic. The die's value matters differently in each space — a
high die on the axis creates more tilt (often undesirable), while a high die on
the radio clears more traffic (desirable). Players must optimize across multiple
competing demands with imperfect information about their partner's resources.
The 4-dice budget is small enough to be graspable in seconds but large enough
to force genuine trade-offs every round.

APPROACH TRACK AS COUNTDOWN TIMER: The approach track serves as both the game's
clock and its spatial puzzle. The plane descends a fixed number of spaces each
round based on engine speed, and various obstacles (traffic tokens, deployment
checkpoints) are distributed along the track. This creates a sequence of
micro-deadlines: traffic must be cleared before the plane reaches it, gear and
flaps must be deployed before the runway. The track makes the game's time
pressure physically visible — players can see exactly how many rounds remain
and which tasks are still outstanding. This transparency converts anxiety from
vague to specific, which is more engaging than an abstract countdown.

SCENARIO SYSTEM AS DIFFICULTY LADDER: Rather than adding rules to increase
difficulty, Sky Team modulates challenge through scenario design. Different
airports present different runway configurations, traffic patterns, weather
conditions (turbulence, crosswinds), and special rules. The base mechanism stays
identical; only the context changes. This is an efficient design strategy for a
lightweight game — it preserves the low rules overhead that enables the 20-minute
play time while still providing a long difficulty curve. Players who master the
base game encounter genuinely new challenges without re-learning the system.

QUICK FAILURE AS REPLAY INCENTIVE: A full game of Sky Team lasts 15-20 minutes,
and crashes often happen faster. This brevity is a deliberate design feature.
A crash does not waste an evening — it wastes ten minutes. The immediate response
is "let's try again," not "let's play something else." The game generates intense
emotional peaks (the crash, the last-second landing) at a frequency that longer
games cannot match. Over an hour, a group might attempt three or four landings,
each building on implicit lessons from the last. The replay loop is where
partners develop the silent coordination that defines expert play.

ALTERNATING PLACEMENT AS INFORMATION DRIP: Players do not place all four dice at
once; they alternate, one die at a time. This means each placement is both an
action and a signal. The Pilot's first placement gives the Co-Pilot information
about the Pilot's priorities and constraints. The Co-Pilot's response gives the
Pilot information in return. Over four alternations, a dialogue emerges — not
through words, but through choices. The alternating structure converts a
simultaneous-action game into a sequential-inference game, dramatically
increasing the interaction density without adding any mechanical complexity.

### What Makes It #33

Sky Team distills cooperative game design to its minimum viable form and finds
an extraordinary amount of tension in what remains. Two players, four dice each,
one shared board, no talking. The game has no hidden traitor, no hand management,
no asymmetric powers in the base scenario, no action-point budgeting — just the
raw question of whether two people can read each other's intentions through
actions alone. The axis balance mechanism forces interdependence at a mechanical
level rather than merely encouraging it through theme. The communication
restriction generates the emotional arc that heavier co-ops achieve through
complexity. The approach track makes the countdown visible and the consequences
immediate. And the 20-minute play time means the game is its own best teacher:
every crash is a lesson, and the next attempt is always seconds away. That this
minimalist design won the Spiel des Jahres — the award most focused on broad
accessibility — confirms its achievement: Sky Team delivers a cooperative
experience as intense as games five times its weight, using a fraction of the
mechanisms.
