## Design Notes

Designer: Mathias Wigge. Published by Capstone Games / Feuerland Spiele (2021).

### Theme Integration

You are building a modern zoo. Not a theme park — a scientifically credible
zoological garden that balances public Appeal (entertainment/revenue) with
Conservation (ecological mission). The tension between commercial success and
conservation purpose IS the game. Every mechanical system maps to a real zoo
management concern: enclosure sizing, species compatibility, geographic
partnerships, university research, breeding programs, and species reintroduction.
The 255 unique animal/sponsor/conservation cards ground the game in real biology
— each animal has continent, specific tags (herbivore, bird, predator, etc.),
and size requirements.

### Core Loop

No fixed rounds. Players take turns until the Break track triggers a scoring
pause. Per turn: choose 1 of 5 Action Cards, execute it at its current strength
(determined by position in your action row), then slide it back to position 1.

Five Action Cards:

1. CARDS - Draw/snap cards from the display. Strength = how many you draw or
   how deep into the deck you dig. Reputation level gates which face-up slots
   you can access (slots 1-2 always available, slots 3-6 unlock at Rep 3-9).
2. BUILD - Place enclosures on your zoo map. Strength = max size you can build.
   Standard enclosures (sizes 1-5), plus special: petting zoo, reptile house,
   large bird aviary, each with unique placement rules.
3. ANIMALS - Play animal cards into enclosures. Strength = max size animal you
   can house. Must have a valid enclosure (right size, compatible tags).
   Animals often trigger immediate effects and provide ongoing abilities.
4. ASSOCIATION - Interact with the Association board. Strength = how many
   sub-actions you get. Options: donate to conservation projects, partner with
   zoos on specific continents, work with universities for research, or gain
   partner zoos/universities. This is the Conservation engine.
5. SPONSORS - Play sponsor cards for ongoing or immediate effects. Strength =
   max cost of sponsor you can play. Sponsors provide economy, abilities,
   and end-game scoring.

### Key Design Patterns

ACTION CARD POSITIONING: The signature mechanic. Five action cards sit in
slots 1-5. When you use a card, its slot number IS its strength. After use,
it slides to slot 1, pushing everything else up. A card you just used at
strength 5 drops to strength 1 — you won't use it powerfully again for 4 turns.
This creates a rhythm: you must sequence your actions across multiple turns.
Using an action at strength 5 is powerful but means waiting. Using at strength
1-2 is weak but keeps it cycling. Tempo versus power, every single turn.

ACTION CARD UPGRADING: Each action card has a Side I and Side II. Side II is
strictly better — stronger effects, more options. You upgrade by hitting
specific milestones (reputation thresholds, icons collected, etc.). The timing
of upgrades creates strategic inflection points. Upgrading Animals lets you
play larger creatures; upgrading Association unlocks donation actions.

X-TOKENS: A clever pressure-release valve. When you need just a little more
strength, spend an X-token to boost any action by 1. X-tokens come from
specific card effects and the Break bonus. They smooth the action card system
without breaking its fundamental tension.

DUAL-TRACK VICTORY CONDITION: Appeal points move your Appeal counter forward
around the track. Conservation points move your Conservation counter backward.
Game ends when any player's counters PASS EACH OTHER. Your score is the value
where they meet (or more precisely, the sum of positions when they cross).
This means you need BOTH — pure Appeal with no Conservation loses, and vice
versa. The most beautiful scoring mechanism in modern gaming: it elegantly
forces balanced play without arbitrary rules.

BREAK TRACK (NON-ROUND TIMING): No fixed rounds. Instead, certain actions
advance a token on the Break track. When it reaches a threshold, a Break
occurs — everyone gets income based on their Appeal, the Break token resets
(at a shorter threshold each time), and play continues. This means aggressive
players who trigger Breaks often can control the game's tempo. Breaks also
determine when end-game scoring triggers.

REPUTATION AS GATING: Your reputation track (0-15) controls which cards in
the face-up display you can access. Low reputation = only slots 1-2. Higher
reputation unlocks slots 3-6, giving you first pick of better cards. Reputation
also gates action card upgrades and provides endgame scoring. It functions as
a meta-currency: investing in reputation doesn't score directly but gives you
better options for everything else.

MAP PUZZLE (SPATIAL EFFICIENCY): Your personal zoo map is a hexagonal grid
with water/rock features. Enclosures must be placed in specific shapes (sizes
1-5), and adjacency to water/rocks matters for animal requirements. Special
enclosures (reptile house, aviary, petting zoo) have their own placement
rules. Kiosks and pavilions fill gaps and generate income. The map is a
spatial optimization puzzle — wasted space is wasted potential.

CONSERVATION PROJECTS: The main source of Conservation points. Projects require
specific combinations of animal tags in your zoo (e.g., "3 primates" or "animals
from 4 different continents"). Completing projects via the Association action
gives large Conservation pushes plus bonuses. Projects create collection goals
that shape which animals you draft — they're the strategic skeleton under the
tactical card play.

PARTNER NETWORK: The Association board tracks your partnerships with zoos on
5 continents and universities providing 5 research types. Each partnership
gives an immediate bonus plus permanent discounts/abilities. Building a partner
network in a specific continent makes animals from that continent cheaper and
conservation projects requiring that continent easier. It's a soft engine that
rewards specialization.

CARD ECONOMY: 255 unique cards across three types (Animals, Sponsors,
Conservation). Cards cost money AND require matching enclosure space (animals)
or action strength (sponsors). The display refills from a shared deck, but
reputation gates access to the best slots. This creates information asymmetry:
high-reputation players see (and can take) better options. The sheer card
variety means every game plays differently.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1-4 players: Each player count uses a different zoo map (different shapes/features)
- Association board scales — fewer partner slots at lower counts
- Solo mode uses an automa deck that advances the Break track and blocks display slots
- Card display always 6 cards regardless of player count (reputation gating handles access)

### What Makes It #2

The action card positioning system. It transforms a card-driven tableau builder
into something with genuine tactical depth — every turn you're solving a
5-turn sequencing puzzle. The dual-track victory condition prevents degenerate
strategies (you can't just spam one axis). The 255 unique cards create massive
replayability without randomness feeling punishing, because the action card
system gives you meaningful choices regardless of hand quality. And the theme
actually works: you feel like you're building a zoo, not pushing cubes. The
tension between Appeal and Conservation mirrors real zoological ethics.
Ark Nova is what happens when a euro designer takes theme seriously.
