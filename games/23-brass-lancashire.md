## Design Notes

Designer: Martin Wallace. Originally published as "Brass" (2007),
re-released by Roxley Games as "Brass: Lancashire" (2018) with
updated rules and art. This is the original game; Brass: Birmingham
is the reimagined sequel.

### Theme Integration

Set in Lancashire and its surrounds during the Industrial Revolution
(1770-1870). Players are competing entrepreneurs building cotton
mills, coal mines, iron works, ports, and shipyards. The geographic
focus is narrower than Birmingham — Lancashire was the cradle of the
textile industry, and the game makes cotton its economic centrepiece.
The board depicts real towns: Manchester, Liverpool, Bolton, Preston,
Blackburn, Burnley, and a dozen more, connected by canal and rail
routes that mirror historical infrastructure.

The theme is structural, not cosmetic. Cotton must reach a market
trade icon (ports or board-edge locations) to be sold — simulating
the export-driven economy of the Lancashire mills. Coal must be
physically transported along connected routes because it moved in
bulk. Iron needs no connection because it shipped in small volumes
by horse and wagon. The rulebook includes historical notes
explaining these choices, and profiles of eight real figures
(Arkwright, Tinsley, Brunel, Stephenson, Watt, Owen, Bessemer,
Coade) — anchoring every mechanism in historical logic.

Ports and shipyards are unique to Lancashire. Ports represent the
trade infrastructure that connected Lancashire's mills to global
markets. Shipyards represent the heavy industry of Barrow-in-Furness
and the coast. These industry types do not appear in Birmingham,
which substitutes breweries, manufacturers, and potteries — a
reflection of the West Midlands' different economic character.

### Core Loop

Two eras (Canal 1770-1830, Rail 1830-1870), each played to deck
exhaustion. Per turn: 2 actions, each requiring a card discard
(exception: only 1 action in the first round of the Canal Era).
Five action types plus passing:

1. BUILD - Place industry tiles on the board (requires specific
   location or industry card)
2. NETWORK - Place canal links (Canal Era) or rail links (Rail Era)
3. DEVELOP - Remove 1-2 lower-level tiles from your player mat,
   consuming 1 iron each, to access higher-level industries
4. SELL - Flip cotton mills by connecting them to ports or the
   Distant Cotton Market; may also flip the port used
5. LOAN - Take 10/20/30 pounds, lose 1/2/3 income levels

Scoring happens at end of each era: link tiles score 1 VP per
connection icon on adjacent locations; flipped industry tiles score
their VP value. At game end, remaining cash scores 1 VP per 10
pounds.

### Key Design Patterns

DUAL-USE CARDS: Every card is both a location identifier and a
generic discard. Build requires the specific matching card (location
or industry type); all other actions accept any card. This creates
the game's signature tension — do you use the card for its printed
purpose or burn it for tempo? The DOUBLE-ACTION BUILD variant (spend
both actions and discard any 2 cards to build anywhere with a
matching industry slot) provides a pressure valve when your hand
doesn't match your plan.

COTTON AS SINGULAR EXPORT: Where Birmingham diversifies its sellable
industries across cotton mills, manufacturers, and potteries,
Lancashire concentrates on cotton. Cotton mills are the only industry
you actively sell. This funnels competition toward a shared
bottleneck: access to ports and the Distant Cotton Market. The
design creates higher interaction density around fewer decision
points — a tighter, more confrontational economy.

PORT AND SHIPYARD SYSTEM: Ports serve a dual role. They are
industries you build and flip (scoring VPs and income), but they
also function as infrastructure that enables cotton sales. An
unflipped port can receive cotton — and flipping it scores its
owner, not the cotton seller. This creates a PARASITIC SYMBIOSIS
pattern: selling cotton through an opponent's port benefits both
parties, but the port owner gets the flip bonus. Shipyards, by
contrast, flip immediately when built — they are pure VP and income
investments, the game's most straightforward industry.

DISTANT COTTON MARKET: A separate tile-draw mechanism that simulates
volatile global demand. When you sell to the Distant Cotton Market,
you flip a random tile that determines how much the market marker
advances along its track. Each sale moves the marker closer to the
"X" (market closed) position. The income you gain from the sale
depends on where the marker sits — early sales are lucrative, late
sales are lean. This creates a DEPLETING COMMONS: the export market
is shared and finite, rewarding aggressive early selling while
punishing those who wait. Birmingham has no equivalent; its beer
mechanism serves a different structural role.

ERA RESET WITH TEETH: At the end of the Canal Era, all Level 1
industry tiles are removed from the board, and all canal links are
stripped away. Level 2+ tiles survive into the Rail Era. This is
more than a soft reset — it's a PLANNED OBSOLESCENCE mechanic. It
rewards players who invested in higher-level buildings during the
Canal Era (scoring them twice) and punishes over-reliance on cheap
Level 1 industries. The network rebuild is dramatic: your entire
canal infrastructure disappears, and you must reconstruct supply
chains using rail links that cost more and require coal.

DEVELOP AS SKIP MECHANISM: The Develop action removes 1 or 2
lowest-level industry tiles from your player mat (costing 1 iron
each), letting you leapfrog to higher tiers without building the
lower ones. In Lancashire, this is the only way to clear shipyard
tiles that show the "cannot build" icon. The action is strategically
critical: spending two actions and two iron to skip four levels of
industry is often more efficient than building those tiles. This
creates a TECH ACCELERATION pattern — experienced players develop
aggressively in the Canal Era to position for high-value Rail Era
builds.

SHARED RESOURCE INFRASTRUCTURE: Coal mines and iron works are owned
by one player but consumed by anyone connected to them. When the
last cube is taken, the tile flips — scoring VP and income for its
owner. Opponents can inadvertently trigger your scoring. This SHARED
COMMONS pattern means that building a coal mine in a central
location is simultaneously a service to the entire board and a bet
that others will consume your resources. The designer forces
cooperation through self-interest.

MARKET PRICING AS SUPPLY-DEMAND: Coal and iron have dynamic markets
on the board. Cubes fill the cheapest spaces first, so building new
mines/works pushes prices down. Consumption from the market starts
at the cheapest available cube, so heavy demand drives prices up.
When you build a coal mine or iron works, excess cubes flow into
the market — you earn money for each cube placed. This creates a
feedback loop: building resource industries is subsidized by market
income, but only when prices are high.

TURN ORDER AS RESOURCE: Money spent each round goes onto your
character tile on the Turn Order Track. Whoever spent least goes
first next round. This SPEND-FOR-TEMPO pattern means expensive
actions (building rail links, high-level industries) cost you
positional advantage. Going first lets you claim contested locations
and sell cotton before the Distant Cotton Market deteriorates.

NETWORK CONNECTIVITY AS SUPPLY CHAIN: Coal must travel along
connected routes to reach the location where it's needed. Your
network isn't decorative — it's the physical infrastructure your
economy depends on. In the Canal Era, you build one slow canal link
per action. In the Rail Era, you can build two rail links per
action but each requires coal, creating a bootstrap problem: you
need coal to build rails, but you need rails to reach coal.

LOAN DESIGN: Loans reduce income permanently — they are never
repaid. The income track has negative values, and the rulebook's
tips explicitly say "do not be afraid of taking loans." If your
income is negative, you must pay the bank at round end, and if you
can't, you remove industry tiles for half their cost. This is a
CONTROLLED DEATH SPIRAL — loans are essential for tempo but carry
compounding risk if income stays negative too long.

OVERBUILDING: You can replace your own industry tiles with
higher-level ones of the same type. You can overbuild opponents'
coal mines and iron works — but only when zero cubes of that
resource type exist anywhere on the board or in the market. This
SCARCITY TRIGGER mechanic means resource depletion doesn't just
raise prices; it opens hostile takeover opportunities.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 2/3/4 players: 10/9/8 rounds per era (fewer players, more turns)
- Location cards and Distant Cotton Market tiles removed at lower
  counts (color-coded banner system on cards and tiles)
- 2/3-player games: players may build in any location (relaxed
  network requirement for the Build action using industry cards)
- Deck tile placement: 1 card per player beneath it in Canal Era,
  2 per player in Rail Era — calibrating endgame timing
- Community 2-player variant uses alternate map with fewer
  locations, a trimmed 40-card deck, and reduced starting money

### Lancashire vs. Birmingham: Design Lineage

Lancashire is the leaner, meaner ancestor. Birmingham added beer as
a universal lubricant for commerce (replacing the port/cotton export
system), diversified sellable industries (manufacturers, potteries),
introduced the Scout action, and expanded the geography. The key
structural differences:

- **Cotton vs. diversity**: Lancashire's single sellable industry
  creates tighter competition. Birmingham's three sellable types
  allow more strategic variety but less direct confrontation.
- **Ports vs. beer**: Lancashire's port system is geographic — ports
  exist at specific coastal locations. Birmingham's beer is
  fungible and must be consumed for selling, creating a different
  resource-management layer.
- **Distant Cotton Market vs. merchants**: Lancashire's export
  market depletes and closes. Birmingham's merchant tiles are
  static — they provide fixed VP bonuses. Lancashire's system adds
  timing pressure that Birmingham lacks.
- **No Scout action**: Lancashire has five actions to Birmingham's
  six. The absence of Scout means less hand-fixing and more
  improvisation with the cards you draw.
- **Develop scope**: In Lancashire, Develop removes 1-2 tiles at
  1 iron each. In Birmingham, Develop removes exactly 2 tiles
  (1 iron total for both in later versions). Lancashire's version
  is more flexible but more expensive.

### What Makes It #23

Brass: Lancashire is the proof-of-concept that birthed a design
dynasty. Where Birmingham refines and diversifies, Lancashire
distills. The cotton-port-market triangle creates a tighter
competitive space — every player is fighting over the same export
infrastructure, the same depleting market, the same coastal
geography. The Distant Cotton Market's randomized depletion adds a
timing pressure that experienced players learn to read and exploit.
The game rewards spatial reasoning (network planning), economic
timing (when to sell, when to develop), and opportunistic play
(using opponents' infrastructure while triggering your own scoring).
Wallace's original design is more constrained than its successor,
and that constraint is the point — Lancashire is a knife fight in a
phone booth, while Birmingham is a chess match in a cathedral. Both
are masterworks, but Lancashire's economy of means is what earns it
a place among the all-time greats in its own right.
