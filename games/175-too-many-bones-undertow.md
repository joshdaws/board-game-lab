### Theme Integration

Too Many Bones: Undertow takes the dice-building adventure formula
established by its predecessor and transplants it to a coastal setting
where Gearlocs face threats emerging from the sea. Where the original
Too Many Bones focused on overland quests through varied terrain,
Undertow narrows its scope to a single besieged settlement, creating a
defensive narrative where players protect their community against an
encroaching aquatic menace. The two new Gearlocs -- Stanza and Duster --
reflect this coastal frontier identity. Stanza is a bard-like support
character whose dice represent songs and sonic abilities, channeling the
oral tradition of a maritime culture. Duster is a gunslinger-alchemist
hybrid, mixing ranged combat with chemical concoctions, embodying the
resourceful frontier defender who fights with whatever tools are at hand.
Their mechanical identities are entirely distinct from the original four
Gearlocs, expanding the thematic range of the Gearloc species from
generic fantasy adventurers to a more varied civilization with specialized
regional traditions.

The Undertow campaign structure introduces a branching narrative pathway
that deepens the thematic investment. Rather than a linear sequence of
encounter days leading to a Tyrant, Undertow presents forking decision
points where players choose which threats to address and which to ignore.
These choices have consequences that ripple through the campaign, with
unaddressed threats growing more dangerous and addressed ones yielding
unique rewards. The narrative stakes feel higher because the settlement's
survival depends on triage decisions -- you cannot fight every battle, so
choosing where to commit your limited Gearloc resources becomes a story-
level decision as well as a mechanical one. The setting transforms the
adventure from a quest narrative into a siege narrative, where the tension
comes not from journeying toward a goal but from holding a line against
mounting pressure.

The standalone nature of Undertow also carries thematic weight. While it
is fully compatible with the base game (all Gearlocs, Tyrants, and
encounters can be mixed), it is designed to function as a complete
experience for one to two players. The reduced player count reflects the
intimate scale of a frontier defense: this is not a war fought by armies
but a desperate stand by a handful of skilled individuals. The tighter
player count focuses the cooperative experience, ensuring that every
Gearloc's contribution is essential and every dice-pool decision carries
proportionally greater weight. The game's identity as a standalone
expansion expresses the narrative idea that this is a different chapter
in the Gearloc story -- connected to but independent from the events of
the base game.

### Core Loop

Undertow follows the same fundamental day-based adventure structure as
Too Many Bones, with key modifications for its branching campaign and
reduced player count:

1. ENCOUNTER SELECTION - Unlike the base game's linear encounter deck,
   Undertow presents branching narrative choices. At certain decision
   points, players choose between two or more available encounters, each
   with different risk-reward profiles. Unchosen encounters may escalate
   in difficulty or trigger negative consequences in later days. This
   selection phase adds a strategic layer before the encounter itself
   begins.

2. ENCOUNTER RESOLUTION - Encounters are either narrative decisions
   (paragraph-style choices with consequences) or combat encounters
   fought on the 4x4 battle mat:
   a) INITIATIVE - Determine starting positions and initiative order
      based on Gearloc dexterity stats and enemy placement rules.
   b) DICE SELECTION AND ROLL - Each Gearloc selects which dice to roll
      from their available pool, up to their dexterity limit. The pool
      includes Attack dice, Defense dice, and Skill dice unlocked from
      the character's unique tech tree. Each die face shows specific
      icons: damage values, defensive stances, skill activations, or
      Bones (wild results usable for Backup Plans).
   c) DICE PLACEMENT AND ACTIVATION - Assign rolled dice to your
      character mat to activate skills, to the battle mat for positioning
      and attacks, or bank unneeded results as Backup Plans for future
      turns. Stanza's dice frequently involve support effects that buff
      adjacent allies, while Duster's dice emphasize ranged attacks and
      area-effect damage.
   d) ENEMY ACTIVATION - Baddies act according to their AI behavior
      patterns printed on their reference cards. Enemies attack, move,
      spawn reinforcements, or trigger special abilities based on their
      type and current battle conditions.
   e) REPEAT - Continue combat rounds until all enemies are defeated
      or the Gearlocs are knocked out.

3. TRAINING AND PROGRESSION - After surviving an encounter, each Gearloc
   earns training points spent to unlock new dice from their personal
   tech tree. Each tree is a branching network of 16 unique skill dice,
   with prerequisites gating access to more powerful abilities. Stanza's
   tree branches between offensive sonic attacks and defensive harmony
   buffs. Duster's tree branches between precision marksmanship and
   explosive area-of-effect concoctions. Each unlock adds a physical
   custom die to the player's active pool.

4. LOOT AND RECOVERY - Acquire loot dice or passive ability cards from
   defeated encounters. Recover HP using poker-style chips. Manage
   inventory within carrying capacity limits. Some loot is encounter-
   specific, rewarding players who chose riskier paths during the
   branching narrative.

5. CAMPAIGN PROGRESSION - Advance to the next day. Review the campaign
   map for upcoming branching decisions. Assess consequences of previous
   encounter choices (unaddressed threats may have escalated). After a
   set number of encounter days, face the campaign's Tyrant in a final
   climactic battle.

6. TYRANT BATTLE - The Tyrant has unique mechanics, an AI behavior deck,
   and escalating difficulty phases. With only one or two Gearlocs in
   Undertow, the Tyrant fight is calibrated for a more intimate scale
   of combat, where each Gearloc must fulfill multiple roles rather
   than specializing narrowly.

### Key Design Patterns

BRANCHING CAMPAIGN AS TRIAGE PUZZLE: Undertow's most significant design
departure from the base game is replacing the linear encounter deck with
a branching campaign map. Players choose which encounters to face, and
unchosen paths have consequences. This transforms the adventure from a
sequence of challenges to survive into a strategic puzzle about resource
allocation at the campaign level: which threats are most dangerous if
left unaddressed? Which encounters offer the best training rewards for
the upcoming Tyrant fight? The triage mechanic adds a macro-strategic
layer above the tactical combat, creating a two-level decision structure
where players must optimize both their moment-to-moment dice play and
their overarching campaign trajectory.

INTIMATE PLAYER COUNT DESIGN: Undertow is calibrated for one to two
players, and this constraint fundamentally shapes the encounter design
and difficulty curve. With fewer Gearlocs on the battle mat, each
character must be more versatile -- pure specialization (all tank, all
healer) is not viable because there are not enough roles to distribute.
Stanza and Duster are designed with this versatility in mind: both have
tech tree branches that provide offensive and defensive capabilities,
ensuring either can flex into multiple roles depending on what the other
Gearloc covers. The intimate player count also eliminates the coordination
overhead that can slow four-player cooperative games, keeping the
decision pace tight and the engagement continuous.

COMPLEMENTARY GEARLOC DESIGN: Stanza and Duster are designed as a
complementary pair whose strengths cover each other's weaknesses. Stanza
excels at support, buffing, and sustain, functioning as the party's force
multiplier. Duster excels at ranged damage and area control, functioning
as the party's primary threat eliminator. When played together, their
combined dice pools create synergies unavailable to either alone --
Stanza's buffs amplify Duster's damage output, while Duster's area
control protects Stanza's more vulnerable position. This complementary
design ensures that two-player games feel like genuine partnerships
rather than two solo experiences happening on the same battle mat.

TECH TREE BRANCHING AS BUILD IDENTITY: Each Gearloc's 16-die tech tree
branches into distinct specialization paths that create different build
identities across playthroughs. Stanza can develop into a primarily
offensive sonic attacker or a primarily defensive harmony supporter.
Duster can develop into a precision single-target sniper or an explosive
area-effect bombardier. Because training points are limited across the
campaign's encounters, players cannot unlock the entire tree -- they must
commit to a path, making each campaign a distinct version of the
character. This tech tree branching gives Undertow significant
replayability within its two-Gearloc roster, as the same character
played with different build paths creates genuinely different combat
experiences.

DICE POOL BUILDING AS TANGIBLE PROGRESSION: The core innovation inherited
from Too Many Bones -- replacing a card-based deckbuilder engine with a
dice-based pool -- remains Undertow's most distinctive mechanical
identity. Every skill die unlocked from the tech tree is a physical
custom die that the player adds to their rolling pool. Unlike
deckbuilders where new cards dilute draw probability, every new die in a
dice-building game is guaranteed to appear every combat round (up to
the dexterity limit). This means each unlock is immediately impactful
and always available, creating a sense of tangible power growth that
card-based systems cannot match. The variance comes from die faces rather
than draw order, and the Backup Plan system allows banking of suboptimal
rolls for future turns, mitigating the frustration of bad luck.

STANDALONE EXPANSION AS DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: Undertow's identity as a
standalone expansion reflects a deliberate design philosophy: providing
a complete, self-contained experience that also integrates seamlessly
with the broader Too Many Bones ecosystem. Players who own only Undertow
receive a full campaign, two unique Gearlocs, and a complete set of
encounters and Tyrants. Players who own the base game can mix all
components freely, using Stanza and Duster in base game campaigns or
fighting Undertow Tyrants with original Gearlocs. This modular
compatibility means each release adds combinatorial depth to the system
without requiring previous purchases, respecting both new players and
veteran collectors. The standalone model is increasingly common in the
hobby, but Undertow demonstrates it at a premium component level where
cross-compatibility requires precise mechanical calibration.

BACKUP PLAN RESOURCE CONVERSION: The Backup Plan system transforms
unused or suboptimal dice results into banked resources available on
future turns. In Undertow's smaller-party context, Backup Plans become
even more critical than in the base game because there are fewer total
dice being rolled each round, making individual bad rolls
proportionally more costly. The ability to convert a wasted roll into
a future guaranteed resource ensures that even poor luck translates into
strategic options rather than lost turns. The system also creates an
interesting tempo choice: banking dice now means fewer immediate
activations but more flexibility later, rewarding players who can
anticipate future combat states and invest accordingly.

### What Makes It #175

Too Many Bones: Undertow earns its rank by demonstrating that the
dice-building adventure formula can be refined and focused without losing
depth. The branching campaign adds strategic macro-decisions that the
base game's linear encounter deck lacked, the intimate player count
creates tighter cooperative engagement, and the complementary Gearloc
design ensures that two-player games feel like genuine tactical
partnerships. Undertow proves that a standalone expansion can be both
a complete experience for new players and a meaningful addition for
veterans -- a design achievement that requires balancing accessibility
against depth, self-containment against compatibility. The game inherits
all the strengths of the Too Many Bones system -- tangible dice-pool
progression, compressed tactical combat on the 4x4 grid, premium
components that reinforce core mechanics -- while carving its own
identity through narrative branching and focused two-player design.
Its position in the BGG rankings alongside its parent game reflects
the community's recognition that Undertow is not merely a supplement
but a distinct design statement about how cooperative dice-building
adventures can be structured.
