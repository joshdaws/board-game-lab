### Theme Integration

Trickerion immerses players in the fictional city of Magoria, a once-glorious
capital of stage magic now in decline. Four illusionists — masters of Mechanical,
Spiritual, Escape, and Optical magic — compete over five weeks to become the
most famous performer and inherit the legendary Trickerion Stone from the great
Dahlgaard. The theme is not decorative; it is the structural skeleton of the
entire game. Every mechanic maps onto the real workflow of a professional stage
magician. You learn tricks at Dahlgaard's Residence (the Downtown). You purchase
components — wood, glass, metal, fabric, rope, petroleum, padlocks, mirrors —
at the Market Row. You prepare tricks in your Workshop by assembling those
components. You set up performances and perform shows at the Theater. The game
does not abstract this process — it makes you live through every logistical step
of being a working illusionist.

The four Magician types are not cosmetic variations. Each has a Favorite Trick
category that provides discounts and special access when learning tricks from
that school. The Mechaniker specializes in elaborate mechanical contraptions;
the Priestess of Mysticism channels spiritual energy; the Master of Chains
focuses on death-defying escape acts; the Great Optico dazzles with optical
illusions. Each Magician's poster card — used for the Advertise action — features
unique artwork that grounds the character in the world. The Specialist system
(Engineer, Manager, Assistant) adds team-building to the magician fantasy:
you are not a lone performer but the head of a growing troupe, each member
contributing unique capabilities that expand your operational capacity.

The Theater itself is where the theme reaches its apex. Performance cards
represent shows at venues ranging from the modest Riverside Theater to the
Grand Magorian. Tricks are not performed in isolation — they are arranged into
full performances with specific time slots (Thursday through Sunday), linked
through shared symbols for bonus effects. The audience's reception varies by
day: Thursday and Sunday shows have yield modifiers that make timing strategically
meaningful. Guest performers can place their tricks in your show, creating a
semi-cooperative dynamic where opponents benefit from your performance. The
Performance phase transforms abstract resource conversion into a narratively
satisfying climax: all the preparation, purchasing, and scheduling culminates in
a magic show where tricks are performed, yields are collected, and Fame is earned.

### Core Loop

The game spans 5 turns (weeks). Each turn progresses through multiple phases:

1. ROLL DICE — Roll the 6 Downtown dice to determine which trick categories
   are available for learning, which characters can be hired at the Inn, and
   how much money the Bank offers. An X result means that die's action is
   unavailable this turn, creating variable action availability each round.
2. SET INITIATIVE ORDER — Rearrange player order based on Fame: the player
   with the least Fame acts first. This catch-up mechanism ensures trailing
   players get first pick of action slots.
3. ADVERTISE — Players may pay coins (1-4 based on initiative position) to
   place their Poster card and immediately receive 2 Fame. A quick Fame
   injection at a cost that scales with current standing.
4. ASSIGNMENT PHASE — Players simultaneously plan their turn by placing
   Assignment cards face-down beneath their Character disks. Each Assignment
   card designates a Location (Downtown, Market Row, Workshop, or Theater)
   where that Character will be sent. This simultaneous planning creates
   hidden information about opponents' intentions.
5. PLACE CHARACTERS PHASE — Assignment cards are revealed simultaneously.
   In initiative order, players place one Character at a time onto available
   slots at the designated Location. Each Character receives Action Points
   based on its type: Magician (3 AP), Specialists (2 AP), Apprentices
   (1 AP). Slot modifiers at each Location add or subtract AP. Players
   spend AP immediately on available actions at that Location.
   - DOWNTOWN: Learn Trick (3 AP) — acquire a new trick card, constrained by
     Fame Threshold and available dice. Hire Character (3 AP) — recruit a
     Specialist or Apprentice from the Inn. Take Coins (3 AP) — claim a Bank
     die's value in coins. Reroll Die (1 AP) or Set Die (2 AP) — manipulate
     Downtown dice to change available options.
   - MARKET ROW: Buy Components (1 AP) — purchase up to 3 components of one
     type from the Buy area. Bargain (1 AP) — reduce Buy costs by 1 coin per
     AP spent. Order Components (1 AP) — request components not currently in
     stock, arriving next turn. Quick Order (2 AP) — immediately add a
     component to stock at +1 coin cost.
   - WORKSHOP: Prepare Trick (1-3 AP) — place Trick Markers on a trick card
     by meeting its Component requirements. Move Tricks (1 AP), Move
     Components (1 AP), Move Apprentices (1 AP) — reorganize resources on
     Specialist board extensions.
   - THEATER: Set Up Trick (1 AP) — move a Trick Marker from Workshop to a
     Performance card slot. Reschedule (1 AP) — rearrange Trick Markers
     between Performance cards. Perform (Magician only) — reserve a
     Performance slot for the upcoming Performance phase.
6. PERFORMANCE PHASE — In Thursday-to-Sunday order, Magicians on Performance
   slots choose one Performance card containing at least one of their Trick
   Markers and Perform ALL Tricks on it. All players with Trick Markers on
   the chosen Performance receive their Tricks' yields (Fame, Coins, Shards).
   The Performing Magician receives additional bonuses: 1 Fame per Trick Link,
   Specialist bonuses (2 Fame per Assistant, 3 Coins per Manager, 1 Shard per
   Engineer), and the Performance card's printed bonus.
7. END TURN PHASE — Pay Wages (1 Coin per Apprentice, 2 per Specialist;
   unpaid wages cost 2 Fame each). Return all Characters. Move ordered
   Components to the Buy area. Advance Performance cards clockwise around the
   Theater (from turn 3 onward, the oldest Performance card and its Trick
   Markers are discarded). Remove Posters. Advance the Turn Counter.

GAME END: After the 5th turn's End Turn phase, final scoring awards 1 Fame per
unspent Trickerion Shard, 1 Fame per 3 leftover Coins, 2 Fame per Apprentice,
and 3 Fame per Specialist. Highest Fame wins; tiebreaker is Initiative Order.

### Key Design Patterns

DIFFERENTIATED WORKER TYPES WITH ACTION POINT SCALING: Trickerion's worker
placement system distinguishes between three tiers of workers, each with
different base Action Points. The Magician (3 AP) is the most powerful but can
only be in one place per turn and is required for Theater performances.
Specialists (2 AP) provide strong utility and unlock board extensions with
additional capabilities. Apprentices (1 AP) are cheap but limited. Slot
modifiers at each Location further adjust AP — a +2 slot gives an Apprentice
3 AP total, making location choice as important as character assignment. This
tiered system creates a genuine team-management puzzle: assigning your Magician
to the Market Row for maximum buying power means they cannot perform at the
Theater this turn. Growing your team through hiring is essential, but each hire
increases your wage bill and competes for limited Assignment cards.

SIMULTANEOUS PLANNING WITH SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION: The Assignment phase has all
players simultaneously place face-down cards beneath their Characters, then
all cards are revealed at once. This creates a prediction game: where will
opponents send their Magicians? Which Market Row slots will be contested?
After revelation, Characters are placed in initiative order, meaning the
player acting first gets the best slot modifiers. The gap between planning
(simultaneous, hidden) and execution (sequential, visible) creates meaningful
tension — you might plan an efficient Downtown visit only to find the best
slot taken by a player who acted before you. This dual-phase structure rewards
both strategic planning and tactical adaptability.

TRICK LIFECYCLE AS MULTI-STEP VALUE CHAIN: Every trick in the game follows a
four-stage lifecycle: Learn (Downtown, 3 AP), Acquire Components (Market Row),
Prepare (Workshop, 1-3 AP), and Perform (Theater). Each stage requires sending
Characters to different Locations, spending AP and resources, and advancing
the trick toward its payout. A trick cannot be performed until all stages are
complete. This multi-step pipeline means that players must plan multiple turns
ahead — a trick learned in Turn 1 might not be performed until Turn 3.
The pipeline creates natural strategic tension between investing in new tricks
(expanding future capability) and preparing existing tricks (generating
immediate returns). Tricks with higher Fame Thresholds have better yields but
require more expensive components and more preparation AP, creating a
risk-reward gradient across the trick deck.

FAME THRESHOLD AS PROGRESSION GATE: Tricks are organized by Fame Threshold (1,
16, and 36 in the expanded game). You can only learn a trick if your current
Fame meets or exceeds its threshold, or you pay the difference in Coins. This
creates a natural progression arc: early-game tricks are modest but accessible,
mid-game tricks require established reputation, and late-game tricks demand
both Fame and expensive Superior Components. The threshold system prevents
players from rushing to powerful tricks without first building a foundation,
while the coin-buyout option ensures that no player is permanently locked out
of advancement. It also means that Fame is not just a victory point total but
a functional resource that unlocks strategic options.

TRICK LINKS AS COMBINATORIAL BONUS: When setting up tricks on Performance cards,
Trick Markers placed in adjacent Link circles that share the same category
symbol create Trick Links. Each Link provides an immediate bonus (Fame or Coins
scaling with the trick's Fame Threshold) and awards the Performing Magician
an additional 1 Fame per Link during the Performance. If a Link circle contains
a Shard symbol, all players with Trick Markers in that link receive a Trickerion
Shard. This linking system rewards players who plan their trick portfolio
around category synergies rather than simply maximizing individual trick yields.
The spatial puzzle of fitting the right tricks into the right Performance card
slots adds a layer of combinatorial optimization on top of the economic engine.

INITIATIVE ORDER AS CATCH-UP MECHANISM: The player with the least Fame acts first
each turn, getting first pick of the best Location slots (those with the highest
AP modifiers). Leading players act last, often forced into suboptimal slots.
This dynamic Initiative Order ensures that Fame advantages are partially
self-correcting — the leader has the most Fame but the worst action economy,
while the trailing player has fewer points but the strongest positional
advantage. The Advertise phase cost also scales with Initiative position (1 Coin
for first position, up to 4 Coins for last), making Fame-boosting cheaper for
trailing players. This creates a rubberbanding effect that keeps games
competitive without artificial handicapping.

THEATER WEEKDAY SYSTEM AS TIMING PUZZLE: Performance card slots in the Theater
are divided into four weekdays: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Each
weekday has yield modifiers — Thursday performances subtract 1 from all Fame
and Coin yields, while Sunday performances add 1. Players can place Characters
on only one weekday per turn, and each weekday slot must not already be occupied
by an opponent. This creates a scheduling puzzle where the most lucrative
performance slots (Saturday, Sunday) are also the most contested, while less
desirable slots (Thursday) offer easier access. The Magician must be placed
on a Performance slot during the Place Characters phase (forfeiting all 3 AP)
to perform in the subsequent Performance phase, meaning the decision to perform
competes directly with the Magician's ability to take actions elsewhere.

WAGE ECONOMY AS GROWTH TAX: Each working Apprentice costs 1 Coin per turn and
each Specialist costs 2 Coins per turn in wages. Failing to pay wages results
in 2 Fame loss per unpaid Coin. This creates a direct tension between team
expansion (more Characters = more Actions per turn) and economic sustainability
(more Characters = higher fixed costs). A player who aggressively hires
Specialists early gains enormous action capacity but must generate enough
Coins through performances and other actions to sustain the payroll. The wage
system ensures that growth is not free — every hire is a commitment to
generating ongoing revenue, and overextension is punished with Fame loss
that can be devastating in a tight race.

### What Makes It #120

Trickerion is one of the heaviest and most thematically committed worker
placement games ever designed. Its 4.26 weight rating reflects the genuine
cognitive demand of managing a multi-stage trick pipeline, a growing team of
differentiated workers, a spatial Theater puzzle, and an economic engine under
wage pressure — all simultaneously. What prevents this complexity from becoming
mere weight-for-weight's-sake is how thoroughly every mechanism maps onto the
fantasy of being a stage magician building a career. You are not pushing cubes
through an abstract conversion engine; you are learning tricks, buying props,
rehearsing in your workshop, scheduling shows, and performing for an audience.
The simultaneous planning phase creates genuine social tension as players try
to read opponents' intentions. The initiative order catch-up mechanism keeps
games competitive. The Trick Link system rewards portfolio planning over
isolated optimization. And the Performance phase provides a satisfying climax
each round where all preparation converts into Fame, Coins, and narrative
payoff. Trickerion earns its weight by making every ounce of complexity serve
the theme.
