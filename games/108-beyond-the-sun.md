### Theme Integration

Beyond the Sun is set in the aftermath of the First Thermonuclear War, as
humanity's remaining factions cooperate on scientific advancement while
competing for dominance over the newly accessible galaxy. The Treaty of
Scientific Exchange — the game's narrative premise — explains why all
factions share the same Technology tree: discoveries are public, but the
decision of which technologies to pursue and the timing of that pursuit
remain the competitive edge. This is an unusually thoughtful thematic
framework for a euro game. It justifies both the shared board state and the
competitive scoring in a way that feels narratively coherent rather than
mechanically convenient.

The Technology board is the game's physical and conceptual centerpiece. It
represents a branching tree of scientific advancement, starting with Basic
Spacefaring on the left and extending through four levels of increasingly
powerful technologies to the right. Each technology card placed on the board
represents a genuine scientific breakthrough — Narrow Beam Lasers,
Terraforming, Advanced Genetics, Hypercomputing — and the prerequisite
structure means players must build through logical progressions. Military
technologies branch from military prerequisites, commercial from commercial.
The first player to research a technology chooses which card fills that
slot, literally shaping the technological future available to all factions.
This captures the theme of collective scientific progress directed by
competing interests.

The Exploration board represents a simplified galactic map with Sol at the
center, habitable systems that can be colonized, shipyard systems where
fleets can be built, and Deep Space where exiled ships drift. Systems are
named after real star systems observable from Earth, grounding the science
fiction in astronomical reality. The dual-board structure — Technology board
for actions, Exploration board for spatial control — creates a satisfying
division between intellectual advancement and territorial expansion that
mirrors the dual nature of civilization building.

### Core Loop

Players take turns clockwise. Each turn consists of three phases:

**Phase 1 — Action Phase**

1. MOVE YOUR ACTION PAWN: You must move your pawn to a new, unoccupied
   action space on the Technology board. The pawn cannot stay on its
   current space. Action spaces appear both on the Basic Spacefaring box
   (printed on the board) and on Technology cards that have been
   researched.

2. REQUIREMENTS: You can only use action spaces on Technologies you have
   personally researched (indicated by your Population cube to the left
   of the card). The Basic Spacefaring actions are always available.

3. EXECUTE THE ACTION: Perform the action printed to the right of the
   space. The four Basic Spacefaring actions are:
   a) Research a Level I Technology — spend 1 Population cube.
   b) Research a Level II+ Technology — spend 2 Ore and 1 Population cube.
   c) Build a Spaceship and Jump 2 — optionally convert 1 Population to a
      ship, then move ships up to 2 spaces on the Exploration board.
   d) Gain 1 Population from Supply and gain 1 Ore.

   Technology card actions grow increasingly powerful, offering ore
   production automation, advanced ship building, extended jumps,
   terraforming, and colonization capabilities.

**Phase 2 — Production Phase (choose one)**

1. POPULATION GROWTH: Examine your Population growth track. For each
   visible growth symbol (not covered by Food production discs), take one
   Supply cube from the corresponding lettered column, flip it to the
   Population side, and place it on your Faction mat.

2. ORE PRODUCTION: Examine your Ore production track. Gain Ore from the
   supply equal to the number of visible Ore symbols (not covered by Ore
   production discs).

3. RESOURCE TRADE: Exchange resources at fixed rates — 3 Ore for 1
   Population, 1 Ore and 1 Spaceship for 1 Population, or 1 Population
   for 1 Ore. May repeat in any combination.

**Phase 3 — Achievement Phase**

1. CLAIM ONE ACHIEVEMENT: If you meet the conditions for any Achievement
   card, you must claim it by placing a disc on it. Only one Achievement
   per turn. Achievements have limited slots (filling left to right for
   decreasing VP). Mandatory if conditions are met.

2. GAME END TRIGGER: When 4 total Achievement discs have been placed
   across all cards, the current round completes (ensuring equal turns)
   and one final round is played. Then scoring occurs.

**Scoring**: 1/2/3 VP per Level I/II/III Technology researched. Level IIII
Technologies score their printed VP. Automation track VP. VP per colonized
System. 1 VP per uncolonized Outpost disc. 1 VP for highest military power
at non-controllable locations. Event card VP. Achievement VP.

### Key Design Patterns

PLAYER-CONSTRUCTED ACTION SPACE: The Technology board begins nearly empty.
As players research technologies, they place cards from the deck onto the
board, creating new action spaces that did not exist at the start of the
game. The first player to research a technology at an undiscovered slot
draws two cards of the appropriate type and chooses which one to place.
This means the action space landscape is co-constructed by the players —
every game produces a different Technology tree with different available
actions. Chan's insight was that worker placement games become stale when
the action spaces are fixed; by making the action spaces themselves the
product of player decisions, he created a system where the meta-game shifts
every session without requiring variable setup or asymmetric factions.

PAWN MOVEMENT AS ACTION DENIAL: The Action pawn must move to a new space
each turn, and each space can hold only one pawn. In a 4-player game with
limited action spaces, this creates natural blocking — your ideal action
may be occupied, forcing adaptation. But unlike traditional worker placement
where blocked means locked out, here you can always fall back to Basic
Spacefaring actions (which have multiple spaces and can be repeated). The
system creates soft denial rather than hard blocking: you are inconvenienced,
not paralyzed. This calibration keeps the game competitive without creating
the frustration of complete lockout that plagues harsher worker placement
designs.

PRODUCTION AS CONSTRAINED THREE-WAY CHOICE: Every turn, after taking an
action, you must choose exactly one production option: grow Population,
produce Ore, or trade resources. You cannot do two. This forced choice is
the game's fundamental resource tension. Population is needed to research
technologies (permanently spent) and build ships. Ore is needed for
advanced research and some actions. But producing one means not producing
the other, and your production capacity degrades as you spend resources —
Population cubes leave Supply columns, reducing future growth; Ore
production improves only through automation. Chan designed an economy where
growth consumes the capacity for future growth, creating a natural
deceleration that must be counteracted through technology and automation.

AUTOMATION TRACK AS ENGINE BUILDING: The Automation track on each Faction
mat represents the technological improvement of production. When you
automate Food or Ore production, you move a production disc from your
Faction mat to the Automation track, which simultaneously reduces current
production capacity and earns VP at higher levels. This is a beautiful
economic paradox: improving your engine's efficiency means temporarily
reducing its output. The decision of when to invest in automation versus
when to produce at current capacity is the game's central engine-building
tension. It also provides a VP pathway independent of the Technology board
and Exploration board, ensuring that players focused on economic
optimization have a competitive scoring route.

ACHIEVEMENT SYSTEM AS GAME CLOCK AND RACE: The game does not end after a
fixed number of rounds — it ends when 4 Achievement discs are placed. Since
claiming Achievements is mandatory when conditions are met, aggressive
players who rush to meet Achievement conditions can accelerate the game,
while engine-builders who need more time must be careful not to trigger
conditions prematurely. The variable Achievement cards (2 basic + 2 random
per game) ensure different end-game triggers each session. Achievements
have limited claim slots with decreasing VP, creating a first-mover
advantage that rewards speed. This design solves the common euro problem
of indeterminate game length by tying the clock directly to player
performance.

TECHNOLOGY TREE AS PREREQUISITE NETWORK: The four-level Technology tree
enforces a branching prerequisite structure: Level I technologies have no
prerequisites, Level II requires one or two Level I technologies, Level III
requires Level II, and some Level IIII technologies require only 2 of 3
prerequisites. The four technology types (Scientific, Economic, Military,
Commercial) have distinct mechanical identities — Scientific automates Ore
and provides research bonuses, Military builds and upgrades ships,
Commercial enables colonization. The prerequisite network means early
technology choices constrain late-game options, creating path dependencies
that differentiate player strategies without requiring asymmetric starting
conditions.

COLONIZATION AS RESOURCE RECYCLING: The colonization action requires
spending ships (returning them as Supply cubes to your Faction mat), which
simultaneously claims a system, earns VP, and refills your Supply columns
for future Population growth. This recycling loop — build ships, move them,
spend them to colonize, get them back as Supply cubes — means colonization
is not just a scoring action but an economic reset. Players who colonize
effectively can sustain Population growth longer than players who leave
ships idle on the Exploration board. Chan embedded the economic cycle into
the thematic act of settling new worlds: the ships are not destroyed, their
crews become colonists who revitalize the faction's workforce.

### What Makes It #108

Beyond the Sun succeeds by finding the intersection of two traditionally
separate design spaces: technology tree games and worker placement games.
The player-constructed action board ensures that no two games present the
same strategic landscape, while the clean three-phase turn structure
(action, production, achievement) keeps individual turns fast despite the
game's strategic depth. Chan's most subtle achievement is the production
system: the forced single choice between Population, Ore, and Trade creates
a resource tension that is easy to understand but difficult to optimize,
especially as the Technology tree opens new ways to generate and spend
resources. Beyond the Sun is a game about making the future — both
literally, by choosing which technologies exist, and figuratively, by
deciding how to allocate a civilization's finite attention between
knowledge, industry, and expansion.
