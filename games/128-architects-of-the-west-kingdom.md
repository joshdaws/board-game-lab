## Design Notes

Designer: Shem Phillips & S J Macdonald. Published by Garphill Games /

### Theme Integration

Architects of the West Kingdom is set in the Carolingian Empire during
the reign of the Frankish kings, where players are royal architects
competing to impress the King through construction. The medieval setting
is not incidental — it structures the game's central moral tension.
The Frankish court valued both piety and pragmatism, and the game
models this through the virtue track, which measures your moral
standing. Building the cathedral raises your virtue; dealing on the
black market lowers it. High virtue unlocks access to prestigious
buildings and end-game bonuses, while low virtue opens cheaper
resources and powerful but disreputable actions. The theme tells you
that in a medieval kingdom, there were legitimate and illegitimate
paths to power, and the game lets you walk either — or both.

The worker placement system reinforces the theme of accumulating
influence through sustained effort rather than single decisive acts.
When you place a worker at a location, they stay there — and placing
additional workers at the same location makes that action stronger.
This models the medieval reality that establishing control over a
resource (a quarry, a marketplace, a workshop) required persistent
presence, not a single transaction. Your workers cluster at locations
you favor, visually representing your growing investment in particular
economic activities. But this accumulation also creates vulnerability:
opponents can capture your clustered workers, representing the
political risks of concentrating your power too visibly.

The Mico's distinctive art style — clean lines, expressive character
portraits, and a warm palette of golds, browns, and blues — gives
the West Kingdom trilogy a unified visual identity that has become
iconic in the hobby. The art does genuine design work: each location
is immediately recognizable, worker colors pop against the board,
and the virtue track's visual gradient from golden light to shadowy
darkness communicates the moral spectrum without requiring text.
The aesthetic coherence between art and mechanism helps players
internalize the game's systems faster than rules text alone would
allow.

### Core Loop

The game plays over a variable number of rounds until the building
supply is depleted or the cathedral is completed. On your turn, you
perform exactly one action by placing a worker:

1. VISIT A LOCATION — Place one worker from your supply onto any
   location on the board. You may place at a location where you
   already have workers; the more workers you have there, the
   stronger the action becomes. Locations include:
   a. QUARRY / FOREST / MINES — Gather resources (stone, wood,
      clay/gold). Resources gained equal the number of your workers
      at that location after placement.
   b. SILVERSMITH — Gain silver (currency) equal to your worker count
      at that location.
   c. KING'S STOREHOUSE — Gain resources from a common pool, with
      better selection for higher worker counts.
   d. WORKSHOP — Hire apprentices (cards that provide ongoing bonuses
      and end-game scoring). More workers allow selecting from more
      cards.
   e. GUILDHALL — Construct a building from your hand by paying its
      resource cost. Buildings score VP and may provide ongoing
      benefits. Access to certain building tiers requires minimum
      virtue levels.
   f. BLACK MARKET — Acquire resources at reduced cost, but lose
      virtue. The black market offers efficiency at moral expense.
   g. CATHEDRAL — Contribute resources to the communal cathedral
      construction, gaining VP and virtue.
   h. TOWN CENTER — Capture all of one opponent's workers from a
      single location and bring them to the town center. Those
      workers are now imprisoned.
   i. GUARDHOUSE — Release your own captured workers by paying a
      ransom, returning them to your supply.

2. ALTERNATIVE: Instead of placing a worker, you may use a special
   action provided by an apprentice card in your tableau, or you
   may take a debt card (loan) for immediate silver.

The game ends when the building supply is depleted or the final
cathedral stage is completed. Final scoring combines building VP,
cathedral contributions, apprentice bonuses, virtue track position
(high virtue scores bonus points; low virtue incurs penalties), and
remaining resources, minus penalties for debts.

### Key Design Patterns

ACCUMULATIVE WORKER PLACEMENT: The game's signature innovation is
that workers placed at locations remain there and stack. Placing a
second worker at the quarry gives you two stone instead of one; a
third gives three. This transforms the worker placement calculus:
instead of choosing which location to visit this turn, you are
choosing how deeply to invest in a location over multiple turns.
The escalating returns reward specialization — but the accumulation
of workers at a single location also creates a target for opponents
who can capture them. This creates a push-your-luck dynamic within
a Euro framework: how many workers do you stack before the pile
becomes too tempting for an opponent to raid?

WORKER CAPTURE AS INTERACTION: The Town Center action allows you to
capture all of one opponent's workers from a single location. Those
workers are removed from the location (weakening the opponent's
future actions there) and placed in the town center, where the
original owner must spend a turn and silver to retrieve them from
the Guardhouse. This mechanism solves a persistent problem in worker
placement games: the lack of direct interaction. Capturing workers
is aggressive but not destructive — the workers are not eliminated,
just temporarily imprisoned. The captured player loses tempo and must
pay ransom, but the capturing player also spends a turn and a worker
on the capture action rather than a productive economic action. This
cost-benefit structure prevents capture from being purely punitive
and turns it into a genuine strategic decision.

VIRTUE TRACK AS MORAL ECONOMY: The virtue track runs from low (tax
penalties, restricted building access, but cheap black market
resources) to high (building bonuses, end-game VP, but higher
resource costs). This is not a simple good-versus-evil binary; it
is an economic system where moral position has concrete mechanical
consequences. A player who invests in high virtue gains access to
powerful late-game buildings and scoring bonuses but pays full price
for resources. A player who exploits the black market gets resources
efficiently but faces virtue penalties that restrict options and cost
end-game points. The design's subtlety is that mixed strategies are
viable — you can dip into the black market early for efficiency,
then rebuild virtue through cathedral contributions later. The
virtue track creates a strategic dimension that purely economic
games lack: your moral positioning constrains your tactical options
in ways that force genuine strategic adaptation.

NO ROUND STRUCTURE — CONTINUOUS PLAY: Unlike most worker placement
games with discrete rounds and a universal retrieval phase, Architects
has no rounds. You place workers continuously until you choose to
retrieve them (or they are captured). This eliminates the artificial
rhythm of "place all workers, retrieve, repeat" and creates a more
fluid game tempo where players operate on individual cycles. One
player might retrieve early to regain their captured workers while
another continues stacking. This asynchronous pacing adds a timing
dimension: do you retrieve now to reset your supply, or press
forward knowing your workers are exposed?

DEBT AS TEMPO MECHANISM: Taking a debt card gives you immediate
silver but imposes an end-game VP penalty. Debts are not repaid
during the game — they are permanent scoring deductions. This design
echoes Brass: Birmingham's loan system but with a more punitive
long-term cost. The value of debt is entirely temporal: silver now
is worth more than silver later because it enables building actions
that score VP exceeding the debt penalty. Experienced players use
debt strategically to accelerate their building program, accepting
the penalty as an investment cost. The debt mechanism also interacts
with the virtue track — relying on debt while also using the black
market creates a compounding penalty structure that punishes
unfocused play.

APPRENTICE CARDS AS ASYMMETRIC DEVELOPMENT: Apprentice cards hired
from the Workshop provide ongoing abilities and end-game scoring
that differ for each player. Because apprentices are drawn from a
shared pool with limited selection, the cards you acquire shape a
unique strategic profile. One player's apprentices might discount
stone costs and reward building variety; another's might boost
cathedral contributions and provide virtue bonuses. This card-driven
asymmetry means players diverge strategically as the game progresses,
even though everyone starts with identical capabilities. The
apprentice system provides the strategic variety of variable player
powers without the setup complexity of pre-assigned factions.

### What Makes It #128

Architects of the West Kingdom earns its position through the
elegance of its central innovation: accumulative worker placement
with capture. This single mechanical departure from the worker
placement template generates emergent interaction, push-your-luck
tension, and strategic depth that more complex games struggle to
achieve. The virtue track adds a moral dimension that creates
genuine strategic variety — games where you pursue virtue play
fundamentally differently from games where you exploit the black
market. At 2.76 weight, it is remarkably accessible for its
strategic depth, making it a gateway to heavier worker placement
games while remaining satisfying for experienced players. The
West Kingdom trilogy has earned a devoted following, and Architects
is its most focused and mechanically innovative entry.
