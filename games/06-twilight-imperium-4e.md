## Design Notes

Designer: Christian T. Petersen (original), 4th Edition developed by Dane
Beltrami with Corey Konieczka. Published by Fantasy Flight Games (2017).

### Theme Integration

Seventeen alien factions compete for control of a galaxy left leaderless after
the collapse of the Lazax Empire. The theme isn't set dressing — it's the
game's structural backbone. The modular hex galaxy is built by the players
themselves during setup, creating territorial claims and choke points before
the first move. Each faction has unique abilities, starting technologies, a
flagship, faction-specific promissory notes, and in some cases unique unit
types — the Nekro Virus assimilates other players' technologies, the Emirates
of Hacan trade action cards as transactions, the Ghosts of Creuss manipulate
wormholes. The Agenda Phase simulates galactic politics: players vote on laws
and directives using the influence value of their planets, and these laws
permanently change the game's rules. Promissory notes function as diplomatic
treaties — tradeable promises that create binding or non-binding agreements.
The whole system models a galaxy where military power, economic control,
political leverage, and technological advancement are all viable paths to
dominance.

### Core Loop

Each game round has four phases:

1. STRATEGY PHASE - Starting with the speaker, each player drafts one of eight
   strategy cards (in 3-4 player games, each player takes two). Strategy cards
   determine initiative order AND grant a powerful primary ability to the holder.
   Unchosen cards gain trade good tokens, sweetening them for next round.
2. ACTION PHASE - Players take turns in initiative order. Each turn: perform
   one action (strategic, tactical, or component), then pass to the next player.
   Continues until all players have passed. Three action types:
   a) STRATEGIC ACTION - Resolve your strategy card's primary ability. Then
      every other player may resolve the secondary ability (costs a command
      token from their strategy pool).
   b) TACTICAL ACTION - The core movement/combat/production action. Activate
      a system (place command token), move ships in, resolve space combat,
      invade planets, produce units.
   c) COMPONENT ACTION - Resolve an "Action" ability on an action card,
      technology card, or faction sheet.
3. STATUS PHASE - Score objectives (one public + one secret per round), reveal
   next public objective, draw action cards, remove command tokens from board,
   gain 2 new command tokens and redistribute all, ready exhausted cards,
   repair damaged units, return strategy cards.
4. AGENDA PHASE - (Activated after Mecatol Rex custodians token is removed.)
   Speaker reveals two agenda cards. Players vote on each by exhausting planets
   for their influence values. Laws permanently change rules; directives have
   one-time effects. Speaker breaks ties.

Win condition: First to 10 victory points (scored from public and secret
objectives). VP track can optionally be set to 14 for longer games.

### Key Design Patterns

STRATEGY CARD DRAFTING: The signature mechanic. Eight strategy cards
(Leadership, Diplomacy, Politics, Construction, Trade, Warfare, Technology,
Imperial) each have an initiative number (1-8) determining turn order AND a
primary ability only the holder can use. When you pick Technology (initiative 7),
you get to research tech — but you'll act late in the round. Leadership
(initiative 1) gives command tokens and goes first — but doesn't advance your
military or economy directly. The draft is zero-sum: every card you take is
denied to opponents. Unchosen cards accumulate trade goods, creating an
escalating incentive to take unpopular cards. In 3-4 player games, each player
drafts TWO strategy cards, amplifying the decision space. The secondary
abilities — available to all other players for a command token cost — mean
every strategy card affects the entire table.

COMMAND TOKEN ECONOMY: Command tokens are TI4's meta-currency. You start with
eight, distributed across three pools on your command sheet: Tactic (for
activating systems — the core action), Fleet (determines max ships per system),
and Strategy (for resolving secondary abilities of others' strategy cards).
Every tactical action SPENDS a token permanently onto the board. Every
secondary ability costs one from strategy pool. Fleet pool tokens passively
limit your naval presence. You gain only 2 new tokens per round in the Status
Phase (plus whatever Leadership provides). This creates agonizing allocation
decisions: more tactic tokens means more actions per round but fewer ships and
fewer secondary abilities. The entire game's tempo is governed by how fast
players burn through their tactic pools.

TACTICAL ACTION SEQUENCE: The primary way you interact with the galaxy. Five
steps, always in order: (1) Activate a system by placing a command token —
you can NEVER activate a system that already has your token, preventing
repeated actions in the same area. (2) Move ships into the active system from
any number of other systems (no command tokens required in origin systems).
(3) Space Combat if two players have ships present — rounds of dice rolling
until one side is eliminated or retreats. (4) Invasion — bombardment, commit
ground forces, space cannon defense, ground combat, establish control.
(5) Production — build new units at your space docks in the active system.
The activation constraint (one token per system per round) is the game's
fundamental pacing mechanism. It prevents turtling and forces commitment.

OBJECTIVE-DRIVEN VICTORY: You don't win by conquering — you win by completing
objectives. Five Stage I public objectives (revealed over early rounds) require
moderate achievements: spend resources, control planets with certain traits,
research technologies. Five Stage II objectives (revealed after all Stage I
are out) demand larger commitments. Each player also has one secret objective
(max three total, gained via the Imperial strategy card). You can score ONE
public and ONE secret per status phase. This drip-feed of scoring opportunities
means the game rewards consistent progress across multiple dimensions, not
just military dominance. A player with zero combat victories can win by
efficiently completing objectives. The scoring structure prevents snowballing:
even a dominant player can only score one public objective per round.

THE IMPERIAL STRATEGY CARD: Initiative 8 — worst turn order, best ability. The
primary lets you score a public objective immediately (during the action phase,
not waiting for status) AND draw a secret objective if you control Mecatol Rex.
Otherwise, you gain 1 VP for controlling Mecatol Rex. This single card drives
the game's tempo. Whoever takes Imperial controls when and how victory points
are scored. Not taking it means your opponents might. The Imperial card is the
reason TI4 games don't stall — someone is always incentivized to push toward
victory, and everyone else must respond.

MECATOL REX AS FOCAL POINT: The center hex of the galaxy. A custodians token
blocks landing on it until someone spends 6 influence to remove it — a massive
investment that grants 1 VP but also ACTIVATES THE AGENDA PHASE for all future
rounds. Mecatol Rex is simultaneously the most valuable and most dangerous
position: it gives VP and triggers the political game, but it makes you a
target. Holding it with the Imperial card is the fastest VP engine in the game.
The custodians mechanic means early game is expansion and engine-building; once
Mecatol falls, the game shifts to politics and conflict.

AGENDA PHASE (GALACTIC POLITICS): After Mecatol Rex opens, every round ends
with two agenda votes. Players exhaust planets to cast votes equal to their
influence values. Laws change the game permanently — granting VP to specific
players, restricting movement, altering combat rules. Directives have one-time
effects. The speaker reveals agendas and breaks ties, making the speaker token
valuable. Players can trade promissory notes, commodities, and make deals
during the agenda phase. This isn't a side mechanic — entire games turn on
political votes. A well-timed law can hand someone a victory point or strip
one away. The agenda phase transforms TI4 from a wargame into a political
negotiation game where military power backs up diplomatic leverage.

TRANSACTION AND TRADE SYSTEM: Players who are neighbors can exchange
commodities, trade goods, and promissory notes during the active player's turn.
Commodities have NO inherent value to their owner — they only become trade
goods (universal currency) when given to another player. This elegant design
means trade requires cooperation: your commodities are worthless until you
find a willing partner. The Trade strategy card (initiative 5) lets the holder
gain 3 trade goods and replenish commodities, then CHOOSE which other players
get to refresh their commodities. This gives the Trade holder enormous
diplomatic leverage. Promissory notes add depth: your faction-specific note
offers a unique ability to whoever holds it, making it a powerful bargaining
chip. The Emirates of Hacan faction can even trade action cards, making them
the galaxy's premier dealmakers.

TECHNOLOGY TREE: Four color-coded branches (Biotic, Warfare, Propulsion,
Cybernetic) with prerequisite chains. Researching advanced tech requires owning
a certain number of technologies of matching colors. Unit upgrades (Carrier II,
Dreadnought II, etc.) improve your plastic units for the rest of the game —
no color prerequisites required. Each faction has two unique faction technologies
that provide powerful asymmetric abilities. Technology acquisition is primarily
through the Technology strategy card (primary: research 1 free + 1 for 6
resources; secondary: spend 1 strategy command + 4 resources for 1 tech).
Some planets have technology specialties that waive one prerequisite when
exhausted. The tech tree creates long-term strategic planning: your first few
technology choices shape your entire game.

SPACE COMBAT RESOLUTION: When two players' ships occupy the same system, combat
proceeds in rounds. Each round: (1) Anti-Fighter Barrage (first round only —
special ability targeting fighters), (2) Announce Retreats, (3) Roll Dice —
each ship rolls dice equal to its combat rating, hitting on that value or
higher, (4) Assign Hits — opponent chooses which ships to destroy, (5) Retreat
if announced. Dreadnoughts and war suns have Sustain Damage — they can absorb
one hit by flipping to damaged side. Combat continues until one side is
eliminated or retreats. Ground combat follows a similar structure on planets.
The combat system is intentionally attritional — no alpha strikes, no instant
kills. This means committing to war is expensive, reinforcing the diplomatic
approach.

MODULAR GALAXY CONSTRUCTION: During setup, players draft hex tiles and
place them in concentric rings around Mecatol Rex. Blue-backed tiles contain
planets; red-backed tiles are anomalies (asteroid fields, nebulae, supernovae,
gravity rifts) or empty space. Players strategically place valuable planets
near themselves and hazards near opponents. Wormholes (alpha, beta, delta)
connect distant systems, creating shortcut routes. The galaxy is different every
game, and the act of building it is the first strategic decision.

FACTION ASYMMETRY (17 RACES): Each faction has: a unique home system tile,
starting technologies, starting fleet, faction abilities (some permanent, some
triggered), a unique flagship with special abilities, two faction technologies,
and a faction-specific promissory note. The asymmetry is deep — the Nekro Virus
cannot vote in the agenda phase but steals technology from players they combat.
The Ghosts of Creuss start in a system connected to the galaxy only via
wormholes. The Xxcha Kingdom can spend command tokens to cast additional votes.
Each faction fundamentally changes how you approach the game's systems.

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 3-6 players: Galaxy size scales (3 rings of hex tiles, number of tiles per
  player varies). Blue/red tile distribution per player changes with count.
- 3-4 players: Each player drafts TWO strategy cards (must resolve both before
  passing). 8 rounds per era.
- 5-6 players: Each player drafts ONE strategy card. Unchosen cards gain trade
  goods.
- VP track: Group chooses 10-space or 14-space track (longer game for more
  players or experienced groups).
- Custodians token on Mecatol Rex gates the agenda phase regardless of count.

### What Makes It #6

Scale married to elegance. TI4 is a 4-8 hour epic that somehow stays engaging
because every system interlocks: strategy card drafting drives initiative AND
abilities, command tokens constrain tempo AND fleet size AND secondary abilities,
objectives prevent military snowballing, the agenda phase turns territory into
political currency, and the trade system makes diplomacy mechanically meaningful.
The 17 factions ensure no two games feel the same. The objective-driven victory
condition means a quiet player building an economic engine can beat a
warmongering conqueror. And the Imperial strategy card is the single best
pacing mechanic in heavy gaming — it ensures someone is always pushing toward
the finish line. TI4 is the maximalist expression of what a board game can be:
a full civilization simulation where military, economic, technological, and
political power all matter, compressed into a single session.
