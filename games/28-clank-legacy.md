## Design Notes

Designers: Andy Clautice & Paul Dennen. Published by Dire Wolf Digital / Renegade Game Studios (2019).

### Theme Integration

Clank! Legacy layers the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise — a comedic
corporate-adventuring property from the Dungeons & Dragons universe — over
the Clank! deckbuilding dungeon crawl. The conceit is that players are
franchisees of a fantasy adventuring corporation, running branches of a
business that plunders dungeons for profit. This framing does real design
work: it provides narrative justification for the campaign's persistent
character progression (you are building a franchise, not just looting
one-off dungeons), it explains why the board permanently changes (your
franchise is establishing a presence in this world), and the corporate
humor gives legacy sticker moments a tonal identity that distinguishes
them from the grimmer legacy games in the genre. The dragon is not an
abstract threat — it is a territorial creature whose behavior escalates
as you repeatedly invade its domain. The Acquisitions Incorporated IP
gives players permission to treat dungeon crawling as entrepreneurial
rather than heroic, which aligns perfectly with the deckbuilding
optimization at the game's mechanical core.

### Core Loop

Each game in the 10+ session campaign follows the base Clank! structure
with escalating legacy modifications:

1. PLAY CARDS — On your turn, play your entire hand of 5 cards from your
   personal deck. Cards generate four resource types: Skill (boot icons
   for movement), Swords (to fight monsters in the dungeon row or on the
   board), Gold (to buy new cards from the market row), and Clank (noise
   cubes you must place in the dragon area).
2. ACQUIRE CARDS — Spend Gold to buy cards from a face-up market row of
   6 Dungeon cards, plus always-available Mercenaries (1 Sword for 2 Gold)
   and Explore cards (2 Skill for 3 Gold). Purchased cards go to your
   discard pile. Some cards in the market row are monsters — spend Swords
   to defeat them for immediate rewards rather than adding them to your deck.
3. MOVE & INTERACT — Spend Skill to move through connected rooms on the
   board. Paths may require Swords (monster tunnels) or Boot icons
   (difficult terrain). Collect tokens from rooms: minor secrets, major
   secrets, monkey idols, gold, and most critically artifacts. You MUST
   pick up an artifact to be eligible for full scoring at game end.
4. DRAGON ATTACKS — Certain market row cards bear dragon icons. When
   revealed during the market refill, they trigger a dragon attack: all
   Clank cubes from the dragon area go into the dragon bag (which also
   contains neutral black cubes). Draw cubes equal to the current rage
   level. Each colored cube drawn deals 1 damage to that player. Black
   cubes are harmless. As the game progresses, rage increases and the
   ratio of colored-to-black cubes worsens.
5. ESCAPE OR PERISH — Once you have an artifact, race back to the
   surface. Players who escape score full points. Players knocked out
   above a certain depth threshold are rescued (reduced scoring). Players
   knocked out deep underground score nothing. The game ends when all
   players have escaped or been knocked out.

Between campaign games, legacy envelopes and the Book of Secrets introduce
new rules, stickers, cards, and permanent board modifications based on
player choices and game outcomes.

### Key Design Patterns

THE DRAGON BAG AS PUSH-YOUR-LUCK ENGINE: The dragon bag is the game's
central tension mechanism. It begins loaded with 24 black cubes (safe)
and no colored cubes. Every time you generate Clank — an unavoidable
byproduct of playing powerful cards — your colored cubes enter the dragon
area, then get swept into the bag on dragon attacks. When cubes are drawn,
black cubes are discarded harmlessly, but YOUR colored cube means 1 damage.
As the game progresses, three things compound the danger: more colored
cubes accumulate in the bag, black cubes get drawn out and removed, and
the rage level increases (more cubes drawn per attack). This creates an
elegant escalation curve. Early turns are safe — the bag is mostly black.
Late turns are terrifying — the bag is packed with colored cubes and rage
is high. The math shifts continuously, and every Clank-generating card
you play is a calculated risk. The dragon bag transforms what could be a
simple race into a probability-management game where you are always
weighing speed against survival.

DEPTH-REWARD GRADIENT: The dungeon is spatially organized so that the
most valuable artifacts and treasures are located farthest from the
surface. Shallow artifacts might be worth 5 points; deep artifacts might
be worth 25 or more. But deeper rooms require more movement (more turns
underground), expose you to more dragon attacks, and make escape harder.
This creates the game's fundamental strategic spectrum: quick-and-shallow
(grab a cheap artifact and escape early, triggering pressure on remaining
players) versus slow-and-deep (pursue maximum treasure but risk being
knocked out). Neither strategy dominates — the optimal depth depends on
your deck's capabilities, the current dragon bag state, and what other
players are doing. When one player escapes, the remaining players face
accelerating dragon attacks, creating an elegant catch-up pressure
mechanism.

DECKBUILDING WITH PHYSICAL CONSEQUENCES: Unlike pure deckbuilders where
cards represent abstract resources, every card in Clank! has physical
board implications. Skill cards move your pawn deeper into danger or
closer to safety. Sword cards clear path obstacles. Gold cards improve
your future capabilities. And Clank cards — the critical negative
resource — physically place cubes that can damage you. The starting deck
is deliberately mediocre: 6 Burgles (1 Gold each), 2 Stumbles (1 Clank
each, no benefit), 1 Sidestep (1 Skill), 1 Scramble (1 Skill, 1 Gold).
The Stumbles are pure liability — they generate noise with zero upside.
Acquiring cards that let you trash Stumbles is one of the earliest
strategic decisions, directly connecting deckbuilding optimization to
survival probability.

LEGACY PERMANENCE AS EMOTIONAL AMPLIFIER: The campaign wraps the base
Clank! loop in irreversible consequences. Stickers placed on the board
permanently alter the geography — new paths open, old ones close, rooms
gain new properties. The Book of Secrets contains sealed envelopes and
packets triggered by specific in-game events, revealing narrative twists,
new card types, and rule modifications that persist for all future games.
Player choices during the campaign determine which stickers are placed
and which secrets are unlocked, meaning each group's copy of the game
diverges into a unique artifact. This permanence transforms routine
deckbuilding decisions into memorable moments: the room you choose to
explore might unlock content that reshapes every subsequent session. The
legacy layer adds narrative weight to a mechanical system that would
otherwise be purely tactical.

CAMPAIGN ARC WITH REPLAYABLE ENDSTATE: Unlike some legacy games that
become unplayable after the campaign concludes, Clank! Legacy is designed
so that the fully stickered, fully modified board functions as a complete
standalone game. The campaign serves as an extended tutorial and
world-building exercise — by the time all envelopes have been opened and
all stickers placed, the board has become a unique, personalized dungeon
that reflects the group's specific choices. This addresses the primary
criticism of legacy games (disposability) while preserving the emotional
impact of permanent modification during the campaign itself.

ACCESSIBLE COMPLEXITY RAMP: The base Clank! system sits at a low
complexity floor — play cards, buy cards, move, avoid the dragon. The
weight rating of 2.74 reflects this accessibility. The legacy campaign
uses this low floor strategically: early sessions teach the core loop
with minimal additions, then each subsequent game introduces a small
number of new rules, cards, or board modifications. By the final
sessions, the game has accumulated significantly more complexity than the
starting state — new card abilities, new board features, new scoring
conditions — but players have absorbed each increment naturally. The
legacy format functions as a distributed tutorial, spreading what would
be an overwhelming rulebook across 10+ learning sessions.

CLANK AS SHARED THREAT ECONOMY: The dragon bag is shared among all
players, creating indirect interaction without direct conflict. When you
play noisy cards, your Clank cubes enter the same bag as everyone else's.
A dragon attack threatens all players simultaneously, but unevenly — the
player with more cubes in the bag faces worse odds. This means your
opponents' deckbuilding choices affect your survival probability. If one
player is generating heavy Clank, dragon attacks become more frequent
(more dragon icons cycle through the market) and the bag becomes more
dangerous for everyone. Conversely, if all players play quietly, the
dragon is less threatening. This creates a tragedy-of-the-commons dynamic
where individually optimal play (powerful but noisy cards) degrades the
shared threat environment.

MARKET ROW AS DUAL-PURPOSE SYSTEM: The six-card dungeon row serves two
simultaneous functions: it is both the card market (where you buy deck
improvements) and the event generator (dragon icons on revealed cards
trigger attacks). Buying a card from the row requires refilling it,
which might reveal a dragon card — meaning the act of improving your deck
can trigger immediate danger. Monsters in the row are defeated with
Swords rather than purchased with Gold, providing an alternative use for
combat resources when no board monsters are accessible. The market row's
dual function means that the pace of dragon attacks is partially
determined by how aggressively players are acquiring cards, linking
deckbuilding tempo to threat escalation.

### What Makes It #28

Clank! Legacy succeeds by combining two proven design paradigms —
deckbuilding and legacy campaigning — in a way that amplifies both. The
base Clank! engine provides a clean, readable decision space: buy cards,
manage noise, navigate depth versus safety. The dragon bag gives this
engine a visceral push-your-luck dimension that pure deckbuilders lack —
every card play has physical, probabilistic consequences in the shared
bag. The legacy layer then transforms a game that could become repetitive
across 10+ sessions into a narrative arc where each play permanently
changes the next one. The Acquisitions Incorporated theming gives the
campaign a comedic tone that makes sticker moments feel celebratory
rather than punishing, and the Book of Secrets creates genuine surprise
in a genre (deckbuilding) that typically lacks it. Most importantly, the
finished product is not disposable — the fully evolved board becomes a
custom game unique to each group, giving the campaign a lasting artifact.
The design's core insight is that deckbuilding's inherent progression
(your deck gets better each game) maps naturally onto legacy's inherent
progression (the game world gets richer each session), making the two
systems reinforce rather than merely coexist.
