## Design Notes

Designer: Vital Lacerda. Published by Eagle-Gryphon Games (2017).

### Theme Integration

Lisboa is set in the aftermath of the catastrophic 1755 Lisbon earthquake,
tsunami, and fire -- one of the deadliest natural disasters in European history.
Players take on the roles of members of the Portuguese nobility working to
rebuild the city under the guidance of three historical figures: Manuel da Maia (the master builder who designed the
reconstruction), the Marquis of Pombal (the pragmatic prime minister who oversaw
the effort), and King D. Jose I (who funded it through royal decree). The
Cardinal also plays a role through the Church track, providing clergy tiles and
wigs.
This is not a generic city-building exercise; every system in the game reflects
the specific political, economic, and religious tensions that shaped Lisbon's
reconstruction.

The card system captures the political reality of operating within a power
structure. When you play a card to the Royal Court, you are visiting a Noble directly --
spending Influence to gain access to their State actions and their powerful Noble
action (building stores, taking decrees, or opening public buildings). When you
instead play a card to your Portfolio, you are conducting commerce -- selling
goods via ships or trading with the Nobles' offices for State actions at the
cost of goods rather than Influence. This dual-use creates a persistent tension
between spending Influence for direct access to Noble actions and conserving
Influence by trading goods through your Portfolio, each path feeding different
strategic threads.

The rubble that covers the city is not a flavor element but a core mechanical
reality. Before any building can be constructed, the rubble from the earthquake
must be cleared, and that rubble becomes a resource -- stone for construction.
Lacerda transforms the historical devastation into a mechanical prerequisite,
ensuring that players feel the weight of reconstruction rather than simply
placing buildings on an empty grid. The wigs system, where players collect and
spend influence tokens shaped like the powdered wigs of 18th-century Portuguese
aristocracy, grounds even the game's most abstract resource in period-specific
social currency.

### Core Loop

Lisboa is structured around a card-driven action system where the single choice
of how to play a card cascades into multiple interconnected subsystems. On your
turn, you first dock returning ships, then either get 1 gold (by discarding a
card) or play a card from your hand to take one of four actions:

1. PLAY A CARD TO YOUR PORTFOLIO FOR SELL GOODS - Tuck the card under your
   player board, resolve its reward or penalty, then sell goods from your
   warehouses onto Ships docked at any player's Portfolio. The goods are sold
   at market prices from the Royal Treasury. When a Ship's cargo hold is full,
   it sets sail and its owner earns wigs.

2. PLAY A CARD TO YOUR PORTFOLIO FOR TRADE WITH NOBLES - Tuck the card under
   your player board, resolve its reward or penalty, then trade 1 or 2 goods
   from your warehouses to the Nobles' offices in exchange for State actions:
   - Manuel da Maia (the Builder) accepts tools or gold: Recruit State
     Officials or Acquire a Plan
   - Marquis de Pombal (the Minister) accepts books or gold: Build a Ship
     or Produce Goods
   - King D. Jose I (the King) accepts cloth or gold: Meet the Cardinal or
     Get a Royal Favor

3. PLAY A NOBLE CARD TO THE ROYAL COURT TO VISIT A NOBLE - Place a Noble card
   on the Royal Court, spend Influence to visit that Noble's office, optionally
   take one of the Noble's State actions without paying a good, then take the
   Noble action:
   - Manuel da Maia: Build a Store in the rebuilt downtown streets
   - Marquis de Pombal: Take a Decree (earns wigs at game end)
   - King D. Jose I: Open a Public Building

4. PLAY A TREASURY CARD TO THE ROYAL COURT TO SPONSOR AN EVENT - Place a
   Treasury card on the Royal Court to take a Political Card (scoring
   objectives for end-game wigs).

After playing a card, draw a new one from the Political card display. The game
is divided into two time periods, each spanning a variable number of rounds. A
period ends when a player completes 4 rubble sets or 3 Political card decks are
exhausted. After the second period, scoring encompasses wigs from stores and
Public Buildings, Decrees, completed rubble sets, portfolio Influence, clergy
tiles, remaining goods and money, and Political cards. The player with the most
wigs wins.

### Key Design Patterns

CARD DUAL-USE AS POLITICAL CHOICE: Every card in your hand presents a genuine
dilemma with multiple distinct resolution paths. Noble cards can be played to
your Portfolio (for their reward and to Sell Goods or Trade with Nobles) or to
the Royal Court (to Visit a Noble, spending Influence for direct access to State
and Noble actions). Treasury cards can be played to your Portfolio (to claim a
subsidy from the Royal Treasury) or to the Royal Court (to Sponsor an Event and
take a Political Card). Any card can be discarded for 1 gold. The same physical
card might provide valuable Influence in your Portfolio, or it might unlock a
critical Noble action if played to the Royal Court. This is not a simple
"action A vs. action B" choice -- each path activates different subsystems with
different timing implications. Lacerda uses the card as a decision compression
device: one object, multiple possible outcomes, each feeding into a different
strategic thread.

INFLUENCE AS GATED CURRENCY: Each player has a single Influence track that
governs their ability to Visit Nobles. Visiting a Noble costs Influence equal to
the Treasury value plus the number of other players' State Officials in that
Noble's office -- meaning popular Nobles become more expensive to visit.
Influence is gained primarily by building Ships and through Church Scoring, and
can also be spent in place of money (reis). If you lack sufficient Influence to
visit a Noble, you can pay the difference in wigs. This creates a strategic
tension between accumulating Influence for powerful Noble visits and spending it
as currency for other needs. Players who invest in Influence gain access to the
game's most powerful actions (Noble actions plus a free State action), while
those who spend it freely must rely on the less direct Portfolio path.

RUBBLE CLEARING AS AREA DEVELOPMENT: The Lisbon city grid begins covered in
rubble from the earthquake. Before any public building can be constructed in a
district, the rubble must be cleared. Cleared rubble yields stone, which is
itself required for construction. This two-step prerequisite (clear rubble to
get stone, spend stone to build) creates a pacing mechanism where the city's
reconstruction naturally progresses from the periphery inward, mirroring the
historical rebuilding sequence. Players who clear rubble benefit twice -- from
the stone gained and from opening construction sites -- but the act of clearing
does not itself score points, creating a tension between infrastructure
investment (clearing) and scoring investment (building).

LACERDA'S INTERLOCKING SYSTEMS DESIGN: Lisboa exemplifies Lacerda's signature
design philosophy: multiple subsystems that are individually straightforward but
create emergent complexity through their interconnections. The card system feeds
into the noble system. The noble system gates the construction system. The
construction system requires the rubble system. The rubble system produces
resources for the market system. The market system generates money for the
treasury system. No single subsystem can be understood in isolation because each
one's outputs are another's inputs. This interlocking architecture means that a
decision in one domain has consequences across three or four others, creating
the feeling of managing a living economic organism rather than optimizing
independent tracks. For designers, this is Lacerda's core reusable insight:
complexity emerges from connections between simple systems, not from complicated
individual systems.

HISTORICAL NARRATIVE EMBEDDED IN MECHANICS: Lisboa does not merely reference
history -- it makes history playable. The earthquake is not backstory; it is the
rubble on the board. The Marquis of Pombal is not a character in a rulebook
sidebar; he is a mechanical entity whose favor you actively court. The
reconstruction of Lisbon's Baixa district is not flavor text; it is the spatial
puzzle you solve over the game's duration. This approach to historical
integration goes beyond typical "themed Euro" design by making the historical
events and figures into load-bearing mechanical elements. Removing the history
would break the game, not merely make it generic. For designers working with
historical themes, Lisboa demonstrates that the deepest integration comes from
making historical facts into mechanical constraints rather than narrative
dressing.

TREASURY AND FAVOR ECONOMY: Money (reis) in Lisboa flows through the Royal
Treasury, not directly between players. When you sell goods, the reis come from
the Treasury. When you play a Treasury card to your Portfolio, you claim a
subsidy from the Treasury. When you buy land for stores, the reis go to the
general supply while the Treasury marker tracks the base cost of land. This
indirect economy means that Treasury card plays deplete the shared pool,
raising land costs and constraining other players' options. The favor system (wigs)
operates as a parallel social currency, spent to gain preferential treatment
from nobles, bypass certain prerequisites, or claim contested benefits. Having
two currencies with different circulation patterns -- money cycles through the
treasury, wigs are spent and removed -- creates strategic diversity in resource
management.

WIGS AS VICTORY POINTS AND SOCIAL CURRENCY: The wig tokens are Lisboa's most
thematically distinctive resource and also its victory condition -- the player
with the most wigs wins. In 18th-century Portugal, powdered wigs signified
social status and political influence. In the game, wigs are earned from
building stores near Public Buildings, from Church Scoring (by surrendering
Clergy tiles), from Ships setting sail with full cargo, and from Decrees at
game end. Wigs can also substitute for Influence when visiting a Noble (1 wig =
1 Influence), creating a tension between spending wigs for powerful actions and
hoarding them for final scoring. The wig system demonstrates how a thematically
specific resource can serve as both currency and victory condition, adding
mechanical texture that a generic "victory point" would lack.

STORE NETWORK AND MAJORITY SCORING: As Lisbon's streets are rebuilt, players can
open stores along them. Stores score based on majority control of street
segments, creating an area-influence game layered on top of the construction and
political systems. The street network connects to the port, where ships provide
trade income. This spatial scoring layer means that even players who lose the
noble influence race can compete by dominating commercial districts. The
majority mechanism also creates direct player interaction in a game that might
otherwise feel like parallel optimization, as players contest the same street
segments for scoring position.

### What Makes It #68

Lisboa is Vital Lacerda's most thematically ambitious design and arguably his
most mechanically integrated. Where many heavy Euros feel like three or four
mini-games sharing a scoring track, Lisboa achieves genuine systemic unity --
every action reverberates through the political, economic, and spatial layers
simultaneously. The card dual-use mechanic alone would be a strong foundation
for a lighter game; here it serves as the entry point into a web of interlocking
decisions that reward both long-term planning and tactical adaptation. The 4.58
weight rating reflects real complexity, but it is earned complexity -- every
rule exists because the historical reconstruction of Lisbon demanded it. For
players willing to invest the learning time, Lisboa delivers the rare experience
of feeling like you are governing a real system rather than playing a game about
one.
