## Design Notes

### Theme Integration

Lisboa is set in the aftermath of the catastrophic 1755 Lisbon earthquake,
tsunami, and fire -- one of the deadliest natural disasters in European history.
Players take on the roles of members of the Portuguese nobility working to
rebuild the city under the guidance of three historical figures: the Marquis of
Pombal (the pragmatic prime minister who oversaw the reconstruction), King Jose
I (who funded the effort through royal decree), and the Cardinal Patriarch (who
provided spiritual authority and managed the Church's considerable resources).
This is not a generic city-building exercise; every system in the game reflects
the specific political, economic, and religious tensions that shaped Lisbon's
reconstruction.

The card system captures the political reality of operating within a power
structure. When you play a card to a noble's column, you are petitioning that
historical figure for assistance -- asking the Marquis to authorize
construction, requesting the King's treasury to fund your ambitions, or seeking
the Cardinal's blessing for your endeavors. When you instead play a card to your
own portfolio, you are acting independently, leveraging your personal resources
and connections. This dual-use creates a persistent tension between cooperating
with the power structure (which grants more powerful effects but advances the
nobles' agendas) and acting autonomously (which is less powerful but serves only
your interests).

The rubble that covers the city is not a flavor element but a core mechanical
reality. Before any building can be constructed, the rubble from the earthquake
must be cleared, and that rubble becomes a resource -- stone for construction.
Lacerda transforms the historical devastation into a mechanical prerequisite,
ensuring that players feel the weight of reconstruction rather than simply
placing buildings on an empty grid. The wigs system, where players collect and
spend influence tokens shaped like the powdered wigs of 18th-century Portuguese
aristocracy, grounds even the game's most abstract resource in period-specific
social currency.

### Core Loop

Lisboa is structured around a card-driven action system where the single choice
of how to play a card cascades into multiple interconnected subsystems. On your
turn, you perform one primary action by playing a card, then optionally take
free actions:

1. PLAY A CARD TO A NOBLE'S COLUMN - Choose one of three nobles (Marquis, King,
   Cardinal). Place the card in their column. Gain the noble's favor effect,
   which varies based on the card played and the noble chosen:
   - Marquis: Authorize city plans, open stores in the rebuilt streets,
     gain construction permits
   - King: Decree royal ships, fund public buildings, access the royal
     treasury
   - Cardinal: Consecrate churches, gain clergy influence, acquire wigs
     (influence tokens)
   The noble also advances on their influence track, potentially triggering
   powerful bonus events for the player with the most influence over that
   noble.

2. PLAY A CARD TO YOUR PORTFOLIO - Place the card face-up in your personal area.
   Gain the card's portfolio effect (typically resources, money, or influence).
   Portfolio cards also score end-game VP based on set collection criteria. This
   action bypasses the nobles entirely but provides less immediate power.

3. DISCARD A CARD FOR BASIC ACTIONS - Take a weaker baseline action (gain money,
   gain resources, etc.). This serves as a safety valve when your hand does not
   align with your strategic needs.

After the primary card action, players may take free actions: sell goods at the
market, visit the royal court for favors, build public buildings in cleared
rubble sites, open stores along rebuilt streets, or acquire ships for trade. The
interconnection between these systems is dense -- building a public building
requires a permit from the Marquis, stone cleared from rubble, treasury funding
from the King, and possibly a wig spent for political influence.

The game ends after a set number of rounds, and scoring encompasses public
buildings constructed, stores opened, ships acquired, portfolio set bonuses,
noble influence track positions, and rubble cleared.

### Key Design Patterns

CARD DUAL-USE AS POLITICAL CHOICE: Every card in your hand presents a genuine
dilemma with three or more distinct resolution paths. Playing to the Marquis
column grants construction authority. Playing to the King column grants
financial support. Playing to the Cardinal column grants social influence.
Playing to your portfolio grants personal resources and end-game scoring
potential. Discarding grants a basic action. The same physical card might be
worth 5 VP in your portfolio, or it might grant a critical construction permit
if played to the Marquis. This is not a simple "action A vs. action B" choice --
each path activates different subsystems with different timing implications.
Lacerda uses the card as a decision compression device: one object, five
possible outcomes, each feeding into a different strategic thread.

NOBLE INFLUENCE AS ACTION AMPLIFIER: Each noble maintains an influence track.
Players with the highest influence over a noble gain preferential access to that
noble's benefits and score bonus VP from their patronage. Influence accumulates
through card plays, wig expenditure, and specific actions. The amplification
dynamic means that early investment in a noble's track makes all future
interactions with that noble more productive -- a positive feedback loop that
rewards commitment. However, other players can overtake you on the track,
stealing your advantageous position. This creates a "king of the hill" dynamic
on each of the three tracks, forcing players to either defend their noble
relationships or concede them and invest elsewhere.

RUBBLE CLEARING AS AREA DEVELOPMENT: The Lisbon city grid begins covered in
rubble from the earthquake. Before any public building can be constructed in a
district, the rubble must be cleared. Cleared rubble yields stone, which is
itself required for construction. This two-step prerequisite (clear rubble to
get stone, spend stone to build) creates a pacing mechanism where the city's
reconstruction naturally progresses from the periphery inward, mirroring the
historical rebuilding sequence. Players who clear rubble benefit twice -- from
the stone gained and from opening construction sites -- but the act of clearing
does not itself score points, creating a tension between infrastructure
investment (clearing) and scoring investment (building).

LACERDA'S INTERLOCKING SYSTEMS DESIGN: Lisboa exemplifies Lacerda's signature
design philosophy: multiple subsystems that are individually straightforward but
create emergent complexity through their interconnections. The card system feeds
into the noble system. The noble system gates the construction system. The
construction system requires the rubble system. The rubble system produces
resources for the market system. The market system generates money for the
treasury system. No single subsystem can be understood in isolation because each
one's outputs are another's inputs. This interlocking architecture means that a
decision in one domain has consequences across three or four others, creating
the feeling of managing a living economic organism rather than optimizing
independent tracks. For designers, this is Lacerda's core reusable insight:
complexity emerges from connections between simple systems, not from complicated
individual systems.

HISTORICAL NARRATIVE EMBEDDED IN MECHANICS: Lisboa does not merely reference
history -- it makes history playable. The earthquake is not backstory; it is the
rubble on the board. The Marquis of Pombal is not a character in a rulebook
sidebar; he is a mechanical entity whose favor you actively court. The
reconstruction of Lisbon's Baixa district is not flavor text; it is the spatial
puzzle you solve over the game's duration. This approach to historical
integration goes beyond typical "themed Euro" design by making the historical
events and figures into load-bearing mechanical elements. Removing the history
would break the game, not merely make it generic. For designers working with
historical themes, Lisboa demonstrates that the deepest integration comes from
making historical facts into mechanical constraints rather than narrative
dressing.

TREASURY AND FAVOR ECONOMY: Money in Lisboa flows through the royal treasury,
not directly between players. When you pay for construction, the money enters
the treasury. When the King distributes funds, they come from the treasury. This
indirect economy means that other players' spending indirectly funds your
potential future actions via the King's treasury. The favor system (wigs)
operates as a parallel social currency, spent to gain preferential treatment
from nobles, bypass certain prerequisites, or claim contested benefits. Having
two currencies with different circulation patterns -- money cycles through the
treasury, wigs are spent and removed -- creates strategic diversity in resource
management.

WIGS AS SOCIAL CURRENCY: The wig tokens are Lisboa's most thematically
distinctive resource. In 18th-century Portugal, powdered wigs signified social
status and political influence. In the game, wigs function as a wildcard
currency that can substitute for influence, bribe nobles, or facilitate actions
that would otherwise require specific prerequisites. Wigs are scarce and
primarily obtained through the Cardinal's patronage, creating a strategic
dependency on church influence for players who want maximum flexibility. The wig
system demonstrates how a thematically specific resource can add mechanical
texture that a generic "influence token" would lack.

STORE NETWORK AND MAJORITY SCORING: As Lisbon's streets are rebuilt, players can
open stores along them. Stores score based on majority control of street
segments, creating an area-influence game layered on top of the construction and
political systems. The street network connects to the port, where ships provide
trade income. This spatial scoring layer means that even players who lose the
noble influence race can compete by dominating commercial districts. The
majority mechanism also creates direct player interaction in a game that might
otherwise feel like parallel optimization, as players contest the same street
segments for scoring position.

### What Makes It #68

Lisboa is Vital Lacerda's most thematically ambitious design and arguably his
most mechanically integrated. Where many heavy Euros feel like three or four
mini-games sharing a scoring track, Lisboa achieves genuine systemic unity --
every action reverberates through the political, economic, and spatial layers
simultaneously. The card dual-use mechanic alone would be a strong foundation
for a lighter game; here it serves as the entry point into a web of interlocking
decisions that reward both long-term planning and tactical adaptation. The 4.58
weight rating reflects real complexity, but it is earned complexity -- every
rule exists because the historical reconstruction of Lisbon demanded it. For
players willing to invest the learning time, Lisboa delivers the rare experience
of feeling like you are governing a real system rather than playing a game about
one.
