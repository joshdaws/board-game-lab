## Design Notes

Designer: R. Eric Reuss. Published by Greater Than Games / Fabled Nexus (2017).

### Theme Integration

Players are Spirits of nature defending an isolated island from colonizing Invaders
who are killing the native Dahan and blighting the land. The theme is a deliberate
inversion of the colonial Euro — instead of settling and exploiting, you're the
indigenous force fighting back. The designer explicitly noted the game was prompted
by a colonization action in another Euro game and the thought "I wonder how angry
the locals are about this new colony of foreigners." Each Spirit embodies a natural
force (lightning, river, earth, shadow, fire, ocean, etc.) with mechanics that
directly express its concept: Lightning's Swift Strike is fast but fragile, Vital
Strength of the Earth is slow but defensive, River Surges in Sunlight pushes
Invaders toward the coast. The Dahan are not pawns — they fight back when attacked,
deal significant damage (2 per Dahan), and several Powers strengthen or mobilize
them. The alternate-history lore (set circa 1700 with modified European colonial
powers) grounds the Adversary system: Brandenburg-Prussia, England, and Sweden each
colonize differently, mechanically reflecting their historical strategies.

### Core Loop

Each turn has five phases, with all Spirits acting simultaneously:

1. SPIRIT PHASE - Each Spirit performs three steps in order:
   a) GROW - Choose one Growth option from their Spirit Panel (add Presence, gain
      Energy, gain Power Card, Reclaim played cards). Growth is how Spirits expand
      their reach and capabilities.
   b) GAIN ENERGY - Gain Energy equal to the highest uncovered number on the
      Energy Presence Track. Energy carries over between turns.
   c) PLAY AND PAY - Select Power Cards (Fast and Slow) to use this turn. Limited
      by Card Plays (highest uncovered number on Card Plays track) and available
      Energy. Elements from all played cards are immediately gained.
2. FAST POWER PHASE - Resolve all Fast Powers (both Innate and played cards).
3. INVADER PHASE - The automated enemy acts:
   a) Blighted Island effects (if applicable)
   b) Resolve earned Fear Cards
   c) RAVAGE - Invaders in lands matching the Ravage card deal damage to land and
      Dahan. 2+ damage to land adds Blight. Surviving Dahan fight back.
   d) BUILD - Invaders in lands matching the Build card add a Town or City.
   e) EXPLORE - Invaders add Explorers to lands matching the Explore card that
      are adjacent to Towns/Cities or the Ocean.
   f) Advance Invader Cards (Explore → Build → Ravage → Discard)
4. SLOW POWER PHASE - Resolve all Slow Powers.
5. TIME PASSES - Discard played Power Cards, clear all damage and elements.

Victory: Generate enough Fear to advance Terror Levels, which progressively ease
win conditions (Terror 1: no Invaders; Terror 2: no Towns or Cities; Terror 3:
no Cities). Reaching Terror Level Victory wins immediately.
Defeat: Too much Blight (Blight Card exhausted), any Spirit loses all Presence,
or the Invader Deck runs out.

### Key Design Patterns

INVADER ESCALATION AS PREDICTABLE PUZZLE: The Invader Deck is a 12-card countdown
(3 Stage I, 4 Stage II, 5 Stage III) that determines which terrain types are
affected each turn. The three-step pipeline — Explore → Build → Ravage — means
when a terrain is Explored, you know it will be Built next turn and Ravaged the
turn after. This two-turn forecast transforms the game from reaction to prevention.
You can see exactly where the crisis will hit and plan accordingly. Stage I cards
show single terrain types; Stage II and III escalate (Stage II adds Escalation
effects with Adversaries; Stage III is more devastating). The deck running out
means defeat — there's a built-in time limit even though you can't see the clock
precisely.

PRESENCE TRACKS AS DUAL-AXIS ENGINE: Each Spirit has two Presence Tracks on their
panel — one governing Energy per turn, one governing Card Plays per turn. Presence
starts covering most spaces on both tracks. When you place Presence on the island
(via Growth), you remove it from one track, permanently revealing the next benefit.
This creates a constant tension: uncovering Energy track lets you play more
expensive Powers but doesn't increase how many; uncovering Card Plays lets you
play more cards but doesn't fund them. Some spaces also reveal bonus Elements,
Reclaim One slots, or other abilities. The tracks are THE engine-building system
— your Spirit literally grows in power as it spreads across the island. Destroyed
Presence is removed from play entirely (not returned to tracks), making Blight
not just a board problem but a permanent power regression.

FAST VS. SLOW POWER TIMING: Every Power is either Fast (resolves before the
Invader Phase) or Slow (resolves after). This is the game's central tactical
tension. Fast Powers let you prevent damage — push Explorers before they Build,
Defend a land before Ravage. Slow Powers are generally more powerful but arrive
after the Invaders have already acted. You must decide during the Spirit Phase
which cards to play, paying for all of them upfront, including Slow Powers whose
effects won't materialize until after the Invaders' turn. This pre-commitment
creates a planning puzzle: can you survive the Invader Phase with just Fast
Powers, or must you invest in Slow Powers that won't help until afterward?

FEAR AS ALTERNATIVE VICTORY PATH: Fear is generated by destroying Towns (1 Fear)
and Cities (2 Fear), and by specific Power effects. Accumulated Fear earns Fear
Cards (one per 4 Fear per player), which provide increasingly powerful effects
resolved at Terror Level I, II, or III. More importantly, advancing Terror Levels
changes the victory condition itself. At Terror Level 1, you must eliminate ALL
Invaders. At Terror Level 2, you only need to clear Towns and Cities. At Terror
Level 3, just Cities. This means a Fear-focused strategy doesn't need to destroy
every Invader — it needs to terrify the colonizers into easier surrender terms.
The Fear system provides a second axis of progress that runs parallel to direct
combat, and many games are won by Fear Card effects triggering at a newly
advanced Terror Level.

BLIGHT CASCADE AS DEATH SPIRAL: When a land takes 2+ damage from Invaders, it
gains a Blight token. If a land already has Blight, new Blight cascades to an
adjacent land. Cascade chains can devastate multiple lands in a single Ravage.
Each Blight placed also destroys one Presence from each Spirit in that land. The
Blight Card starts Healthy side up with a limited pool (5 per player). When
exhausted, it flips to Blighted Island, adding a permanent penalty (e.g., "each
Spirit destroys 1 of their Presence each Invader Phase") and refilling some
Blight. If the Blighted side runs out, the game is lost. This cascade mechanic
creates urgency: a single undefended Ravage in a land with existing Blight can
chain-react across the island, destroying Presence and pushing toward defeat.

ELEMENT THRESHOLDS FOR INNATE POWERS: Each Spirit has Innate Powers on their panel
that activate only when the Spirit has accumulated specific Elements from played
Power Cards. Elements are not spent — they're checked. Having 3 Fire and 2 Air
might unlock the second tier of an Innate Power. This creates a deckbuilding
consideration beyond card effects: sometimes you play a Power Card primarily for
its Elements to hit an Innate threshold, even if the card's own effect is
irrelevant. Higher thresholds on Innate Powers unlock dramatically stronger
effects, rewarding commitment to an elemental strategy.

SPIRIT ASYMMETRY AS DESIGN FOUNDATION: The 8 base spirits aren't variations —
they're fundamentally different games. Lightning's Swift Strike has almost all
Fast Powers and excels at destroying Invaders directly but has low Energy growth.
A Spread of Rampant Green generates Presence rapidly and chokes out Invaders
through territory control. Ocean's Hungry Grasp can only act on Coastal lands
but drowns everything pushed to its shores. Each Spirit has unique Growth options,
Presence Track layouts, Innate Powers, starting hand, and Special Rules. The
complexity ratings (Low to High) create a built-in difficulty curve for learning
the system. This asymmetry means cooperative discussion is essential — no single
Spirit can handle every threat, so players must coordinate coverage.

COOPERATIVE WITHOUT QUARTERBACKING: The designer explicitly aimed to solve the
"alpha player" problem in co-ops. Several design choices accomplish this:
simultaneous play (everyone acts in the Spirit Phase at once), asymmetric
information (each Spirit has unique Powers and capabilities that are hard for
others to track), spatial separation (each player starts on their own board
section), and complexity (the decision space is large enough that no single
player can optimize for everyone). Table talk is encouraged but the information
load prevents one player from directing others.

ADVERSARY SYSTEM AS MODULAR DIFFICULTY: The three Adversaries (Brandenburg-Prussia,
England, Sweden) each modify the Invader behavior at 6 escalating levels, creating
a difficulty scale from 0 to 10. Brandenburg-Prussia accelerates the Invader
Deck timeline. England generates extra Builds and immigrants. Sweden's Ravages
are more destructive and assimilate Dahan. Each Adversary changes optimal Spirit
selection and strategy, providing structured replayability beyond just "harder."

### Scaling Mechanisms

- 1 player: Single board, solo mode. Can target self with "Another Spirit" Powers
  but loses multi-Spirit synergy benefits.
- 2 players: Two boards joined at edges. The canonical experience.
- 3-4 players: Three or four boards in specific configurations. More terrain types
  in play simultaneously, requiring broader coordination.
- Difficulty is primarily scaled through Adversary levels (0-10) and Scenarios
  rather than player count, allowing consistent challenge across group sizes.

### What Makes It #11

Spirit Island is the most mechanically distinctive cooperative game on this list.
Where most co-ops present a shared puzzle with a unified team, Spirit Island gives
each player a genuinely different game to play — different resources, different
capabilities, different spatial reach — and asks them to coordinate without any
single player being able to see the whole picture. The Invader escalation pipeline
provides perfect information about future threats, turning the game into a
prevention puzzle rather than a reaction game. The Fear system ensures there are
always two paths to victory running in parallel. The anti-colonial theme isn't
cosmetic — it shapes every mechanic, from the Invaders' automated expansion to
the Spirits' connection to terrain to the Dahan's autonomous counterattacks.
The Adversary system provides a difficulty ladder that changes strategy, not
just numbers. And the Presence Tracks create an engine-building arc where your
Spirit literally grows more powerful as it spreads — until Blight starts destroying
that progress.
