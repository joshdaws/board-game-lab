## Design Notes

Designer: Vlaada Chvátil. Published by Czech Games Edition (2015, revised from 2006 original).

### Theme Integration

Through the Ages abstracts the entire sweep of human civilization — from Antiquity
through the Modern Age — into a pure card game with no board. There are no territories
to conquer, no maps to traverse. Instead, civilization IS your tableau of cards:
farms produce food, mines produce resources, labs generate science, temples and
theaters generate culture, and military units project strength. Leaders represent
historical figures (Homer, Moses, Genghis Khan, Shakespeare, Einstein, Gandhi) whose
abilities bend the rules in era-appropriate ways — Homer generates culture from
Warriors, Newton converts science production, Gandhi makes your civilization
pacifist but culturally powerful. Wonders like the Pyramids, Taj Mahal, and
Internet each provide era-specific bonuses that mirror their historical significance.
The abstraction is deliberate: Chvátil strips away geography to focus entirely on
the engine-building puzzle of civilization development, making the game about
resource allocation decisions rather than spatial conflict. The "New Story" revision
(2015) rebalanced the original 2006 design extensively, addressing dominant
strategies and making military more meaningful without making it oppressive.

### Core Loop

Each turn follows a fixed sequence, with all action points spent within the turn:

1. CARD ROW MANAGEMENT - Remove the oldest cards from the card row (leftmost
   positions), shift remaining cards left, deal new cards from the current age
   deck to fill the rightmost positions. Cards age along the row — cheap to take
   when old, expensive when new.
2. POLITICS PHASE - Play at most ONE political action: place an event or territory
   card face-down on the future events deck (scoring culture equal to its age),
   play an aggression against another player, declare war (resolves next round),
   or propose/dissolve a pact (3-4 player games only).
3. ACTION PHASE - Spend civil actions and military actions:
   CIVIL ACTIONS: Take a card from the card row (cost 1-3 depending on position),
   increase population (pay food), build/upgrade/destroy structures, construct a
   wonder stage, play an action card, or declare a revolution (changing government,
   costs ALL civil actions).
   MILITARY ACTIONS: Build/upgrade/destroy military units, or play a tactics card
   to organize armies.
4. END OF TURN - Discard excess military cards. Production Phase: score science
   and culture, check corruption, produce food from farms, pay consumption from
   population, produce resources from mines. Draw military cards (1 per unused
   military action, max 3).

Victory: The player with the most culture points at the end of Age III wins.
Culture accumulates throughout the game from production each turn, event cards,
wonders, and final scoring bonuses.

### Key Design Patterns

CARD ROW AS TEMPORAL MARKET: The card row is Through the Ages' defining mechanism.
Cards enter on the right (expensive: 3 civil actions to take) and slide left each
turn as older cards are discarded. A card that costs 3 actions when it first appears
may cost only 1 action two turns later — but it might be taken by an opponent first.
This creates a continuous drafting tension: do you pay premium for a powerful card
now, or gamble that it survives to become cheaper? The removal of leftmost cards
each turn means nothing stays available forever. The card row replaces the
traditional board game notion of spatial exploration with a temporal economy — your
"territory" is your ability to grab the right cards at the right time. Different
player counts change how many cards are removed each turn, scaling the pressure.

ACTION POINTS AS CONSTRAINT CURRENCY: Civil actions and military actions are
separate pools determined by your government type. Starting with Despotism (4 civil,
2 military), governments upgrade through the ages — Republic, Monarchy, Theocracy,
Constitutional Monarchy, Democracy, Communism, Fundamentalism — each offering
different civil/military ratios and special abilities. Changing government via
revolution costs ALL civil actions for the turn, making it a massive tempo
investment. The split between civil and military actions forces a fundamental
strategic choice: build your economic engine or invest in military strength. Since
military actions also determine how many military cards you draw each turn, even
a peaceful civilization must consider its military action budget.

TECHNOLOGY OBSOLESCENCE AND AGE TRANSITIONS: Technologies exist in four ages
(A through III), with each age's cards being strictly superior to the previous.
An Age I Farm produces 2 food per worker; an Age II Farm produces 3. But you can't
just buy the better version — you must UPGRADE existing workers from old technology
to new, spending civil actions and resources for each worker moved. This creates a
constant modernization pressure: your Age I infrastructure still works, but an
opponent with Age II technology produces more with the same workers. When an age's
civil deck runs out, all cards from two ages prior become "antiquated" and are
discarded from the card row (and leaders/unfinished wonders from the table). The
age transition also costs each player 2 yellow tokens (population), representing
the upheaval of era change. This obsolescence system prevents early-game advantages
from lasting forever and forces continuous reinvestment.

CORRUPTION AS ANTI-HOARDING: Resources and food are stored on technology cards
in your tableau, but your blue bank (which supplies these tokens) has limited
capacity. When your bank runs low, corruption kicks in — you lose resources equal
to the negative numbers exposed on your bank track. This elegantly prevents
indefinite stockpiling. A player who produces heavily but doesn't spend will see
their surplus eaten by corruption. The solution is either to spend resources
immediately (building, upgrading) or to increase bank capacity through technologies.
Corruption ensures that production without purpose is wasteful, rewarding efficient
engine cycling over passive accumulation.

HAPPINESS AS POPULATION CONSTRAINT: Every idle worker (not placed on a technology
card) is potentially discontent. Your happiness rating — generated by temples,
theaters, arenas, and certain wonders/leaders — must equal or exceed your idle
workers. If discontent workers outnumber available happiness, you face an uprising:
your entire Production Phase is SKIPPED. No science, no culture, no food, no
resources. This is devastating. Happiness thus acts as a population governor —
you can't grow your workforce faster than your entertainment infrastructure can
support. It also creates a strategic niche for culture-generating buildings that
might otherwise seem less urgent than farms and mines.

MILITARY AS POLITICAL LEVERAGE: Military strength in Through the Ages serves three
purposes: deterrence, aggression, and event resolution. Aggressions let a stronger
player steal resources, science, or even population from a weaker one — but the
attacker must spend military actions and the defender can play bonus cards to resist.
Wars are declared one round in advance, giving the defender time to build up, but
bonus cards can't be used in war resolution. Events (placed face-down on the future
events deck) often reward the strongest player or punish the weakest, creating
indirect pressure to maintain competitive military even if you never attack. The
military system ensures that a pure economic strategy is vulnerable — you don't need
to fight, but you need to be strong enough that fighting you isn't worth it. The
colonies/territories system adds another military dimension: when territory events
are revealed, players bid military units (sacrificing them) for permanent bonuses.

CULTURE VS. SCIENCE AS DUAL CURRENCY: Culture points determine who wins — they
accumulate each turn from your culture rating (generated by theaters, libraries,
temples, and wonders). Science points are spent to discover new technologies,
determining the pace of your modernization. A civilization that ignores science
falls behind in technology; one that ignores culture might have the best engine
but insufficient victory points. This dual-currency system creates the game's
central long-term tension. Early investment in science accelerates your engine
but generates no culture. Early investment in culture scores points but leaves
you technologically behind. The optimal path weaves between both, using science
to unlock culture-generating technologies that compound over time.

LEADERS AND WONDERS AS TEMPORAL EXCLUSIVES: Each age offers a handful of leaders
and wonders, but you can only have one leader at a time, and only one wonder under
construction. Leaders provide powerful ongoing effects but are replaced when you
draft a new one (or become antiquated at age transitions). Wonders require multiple
construction stages (spending resources over several turns) but provide permanent
benefits once completed. The exclusivity creates drafting tension — taking a leader
denies it to all opponents, and the card row aging means a wonder you're eyeing
might be grabbed or discarded before you can afford it. Leaders define your
strategy for an era (Moses enables rapid population growth, Michelangelo converts
resources to culture), while wonders provide permanent infrastructure.

EVENTS AS PLAYER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE: The event system is uniquely player-driven.
When you play an event card as a political action, it goes face-down onto the
FUTURE events deck, and the current top event is revealed and resolved. This means
events you play won't trigger until a future turn (possibly much later), and you
score culture just for seeding them. Players shape the event landscape by choosing
which events to seed — military players seed events that reward high strength,
culture players seed events that reward culture production. The two-deck system
(future events become current events when the current deck empties) creates
strategic timing: you can predict roughly when your seeded events will fire. Age
III events determine final scoring bonuses, making the endgame event deck
critically important.

### What Makes It #16

Through the Ages distills civilization building to its purest strategic form. By
eliminating a map, Chvátil forces every decision into a single resource-management
framework where the card row IS your entire strategic landscape. The action point
system constrains every turn into agonizing trade-offs between growth, technology,
military, and culture. The age-transition system prevents any single strategy from
dominating across the entire game — what works in Antiquity is obsolete by Age II.
Military is essential but not sufficient; culture is the goal but not self-sustaining
without science and resources to fuel it. The event system lets players shape the
political landscape, and aggressions/wars ensure that no civilization exists in
isolation. At 4.44 weight, it demands complete attention to interlocking systems
across a 2-3 hour arc, rewarding players who can see three ages ahead while
optimizing each individual turn.
