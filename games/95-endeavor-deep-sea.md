### Theme Integration

Endeavor: Deep Sea reimagines the Endeavor franchise as an oceanic research
expedition, replacing the colonial exploration theme of the original Age of
Sail with something more contemporary and morally uncomplicated: the
scientific exploration of the deep ocean. Players lead marine research
organizations deploying Vessels, recruiting Specialists, and
exploring increasingly deep ocean zones. The theme is not merely a
reskin -- it fundamentally reshapes the game's spatial logic. Where
Age of Sail had continents to discover and trade routes to establish,
Deep Sea has vertical depth zones that represent progressively more
extreme environments, each requiring more advanced technology to access
and yielding greater scientific discoveries.

The depth-as-difficulty metaphor is elegantly expressed through the game's
mechanics. Shallow zones are accessible early and yield basic rewards;
deep zones require higher Ingenuity (technology level) to access and contain
more valuable opportunities. This vertical progression mirrors real oceanography -- from the Surface
and Epipelagic zones near the top, through the Mesopelagic and
Bathypelagic zones, down to the Abyssopelagic zone at the deepest
reaches. Players feel the increasing
pressure (literal and figurative) as they push deeper, investing
progressively more resources for progressively greater rewards. The
theme transforms what could be an abstract engine-building exercise
into a narrative of scientific ambition.

The Journal system reinforces the educational dimension. Publishing
Journals by spending Research points mirrors the work of real marine
scientists sharing discoveries. The Impact board represents the broader
effect of your research on ocean conservation -- you are not just
exploring for personal gain but creating lasting positive change. The
theme succeeds because it gives every mechanical action a narrative
context: moving a Vessel is sending an expedition, placing a disc on
a Sonar track is surveying the ocean floor, publishing a Journal is
sharing a scientific discovery with the world.

### Core Loop

Each round follows a two-phase structure:

1. **PHASE 1: PREPARATION** -- Each player conducts three steps:
   a. **Recruitment** -- Choose one Specialist tile from the tray and add
      it (Junior side up) to your tableau. Your Reputation track
      determines the highest tier from which you can recruit.
   b. **Effort** -- Gain new discs from your supply to your Staging Area.
      Your Inspiration track determines how many discs you gain.
   c. **Reassignment** -- Reclaim discs from your activated Specialists
      back to your Staging Area. Your Coordination track determines how
      many discs you may reclaim.

2. **PHASE 2: ACTIVATION** -- Players take turns clockwise, each either
   activating a Specialist or passing. To activate a Specialist, place
   a disc from your Staging Area onto its empty activation circle, then
   perform its action(s). Actions include:
   - **Travel** -- Move a Vessel to a different zone, gaining its Arrival
     bonus. Distance and depth limited by Ingenuity track.
   - **Sonar** -- Place a disc on a Sonar track in a zone with your
     Vessel, gaining rewards and often Discovering new ocean zones.
   - **Dive** -- Draw a Dive token from a Dive site in a zone with your
     Vessel, gaining Research or special effects.
   - **Conserve** -- Spend Research to place a disc at a Conservation site,
     gaining rewards (often Impact).
   - **Journal** -- Spend Research to publish a Journal, gaining
     Promotions and other benefits.
   Play continues until all players have passed.

3. **END OF ROUND** -- If the sixth round is complete, proceed to final
   scoring. Otherwise, pass the Wave marker clockwise and begin a new
   round.

### Key Design Patterns

DEPTH ZONES AS PROGRESSIVE DIFFICULTY/REWARD TIERS: The ocean board is
organized into five depth levels -- from the Surface zone at the top to
the Abyssopelagic zone at the bottom. Shallower zones are accessible
early and yield basic rewards. Deeper zones require higher Ingenuity
track advancement (which controls both maximum depth and travel distance
for Vessels), but they contain more valuable Sonar rewards, Conservation
sites, and Dive tokens. This tiered structure creates a natural progression arc within
each game: players begin in shallow waters building basic capabilities,
then gradually extend their reach deeper as their engine matures. The
design lesson is that progressive access gating -- where content becomes
available as players invest in prerequisites -- creates a satisfying
sense of growth without requiring explicit level-up mechanics.

DISC ECONOMY AND REASSIGNMENT CYCLE: The core rhythm of Endeavor: Deep
Sea is activate-then-reassign. Discs placed on Specialists during the
Activation phase are reclaimed during the next round's Reassignment
step, limited by your Coordination track. Discs placed on ocean zone
sites (Sonar tracks, Conservation sites, Journal sites), however, stay
permanently -- they represent lasting presence in the ocean. This
creates a fundamental tension: Specialist activations are renewable
(discs cycle back) but ocean placements are permanent commitments.
As the game progresses, your available disc pool can shrink unless you
gain new discs through the Inspiration track. The Reassignment cycle
rewards planning across multiple rounds -- the Coordination track
determines how many discs you can reclaim, making investment in
Coordination crucial for sustaining a high tempo of actions.

ATTRIBUTE TRACKS AS ENGINE CONSTRUCTION: Four attribute tracks --
Reputation, Inspiration, Coordination, and Ingenuity -- govern the
game's core capabilities. Each track position unlocks new capabilities:
higher Reputation grants access to higher-tier Specialists, higher
Inspiration provides more discs each round, higher Coordination allows
reclaiming more discs from activated Specialists, and higher Ingenuity
unlocks deeper Vessel travel and additional Vessels. The tracks are the
game's engine: advancing them is how you expand your action vocabulary
and reach. A separate Research track stores Research points needed for
Conserve and Journal actions. The design elegance is that track
advancement comes from the rewards of Specialist actions and ocean
zone exploration, creating a bootstrapping loop -- you must take
actions to gain the capabilities that make future actions more powerful.

DIVE TOKENS AS VARIABLE RESOURCES: Dive tokens drawn from Dive sites
provide Research points (the game's spendable currency for Conserve
and Journal actions) and varied special effects. When spending a token,
players choose between banking its Research value or using its effect,
creating a constant valuation tension. The Research track has a maximum
of twelve, so timing your spending matters. Dive tokens can also be
spent in place of activating a Specialist, adding flexibility. This
system interacts with the depth zone structure -- deeper zones may offer
more valuable Dive sites but require greater Ingenuity to access.

LINKS AS COLLABORATIVE PRESENCE: Ocean zones feature links connecting
sites (Sonar tracks, Conservation sites, Journal sites). When both ends
of a link are occupied by discs, the link is completed and both players
with discs at either end gain the link's reward. This creates a shared
incentive structure -- your disc placements can benefit opponents and
vice versa. The link system means that disc placement is not just about
individual site value but about connectivity -- completing links
generates bonus rewards that compound over time. The design pattern
is that shared-benefit interaction creates interesting decisions about
when to place discs that may help opponents.

SPECIALIST PROMOTION AS UPGRADE SYSTEM: Specialists enter play on their
Junior (blue) side and can be Promoted to their Senior (gold) side,
gaining enhanced actions and additional attribute bonuses. Promotion
is earned as a reward from various game actions. This two-sided tile
design creates a natural progression within each Specialist -- you
recruit them as Junior members and invest in developing them into
Senior experts. The promotion decision is also strategic: promoting
a Specialist requires discarding the disc on it (if any), freeing
both the disc and the Specialist for future activation. The design
consequence is that your team develops character over the game, with
promoted Seniors providing more powerful actions than their Junior
counterparts.

SHARED OCEAN BOARD AS INTERACTION SPACE: While each player has their
own Specialist tableau and player mat, the ocean zones are shared.
Sonar track spaces, Conservation sites, Journal sites, and Dive tokens
are contested resources. When one player occupies a site, that space
is no longer available to others. The shared board
creates interaction without direct conflict -- you are not attacking
opponents but competing for limited positional advantage in the same
physical space. The tension between developing your private engine
(Specialists and attribute tracks) and competing on the shared board (ocean
presence) is the game's central strategic balance.

DEPTH PRESSURE AS RESOURCE COST ESCALATION: The deeper you go, the
more everything costs. Deep-zone Vessels require more Ingenuity track
advancement and more actions to reach.
This escalating cost structure mirrors real deep-sea operations, where
pressure, darkness, and distance compound the difficulty of every
activity. The design function of cost escalation is pacing: it prevents
players from rushing to the most valuable content and ensures that the
early game (shallow exploration) and late game (deep expeditions) feel
meaningfully different. The escalation also creates catch-up potential
-- a player who falls behind in shallow zones can invest in track
advancement and leapfrog to deep-zone opportunities that early
leaders have not yet accessed.

SIX-ROUND ARC AS NARRATIVE STRUCTURE: The game's fixed six-round
structure creates a clear narrative arc: expedition planning (round 1),
initial exploration (round 2), capability building (round 3), expansion
and specialization (round 4), deep-sea push (round 5), and final scoring
optimization (round 6). Each round introduces more powerful specialists
into the tableau, meaning that the action vocabulary expands naturally
over time. The six-round constraint also creates urgency -- with only
six cycles of preparation and activation, every specialist activation
carries significant opportunity cost. The design lesson is that fixed-length games with
escalating content create natural story arcs without requiring
explicit narrative mechanisms.

### What Makes It #95

Endeavor: Deep Sea succeeds by finding the intersection of engine building,
worker placement, and spatial exploration, then grounding that intersection
in a theme that makes every mechanism legible. The depth-zone structure
gives the game a vertical progression that feels qualitatively different
from the horizontal expansion of most exploration games -- you are not
spreading outward across a map but pushing downward into increasingly
hostile territory, and the mechanical cost escalation mirrors that
physical reality. The action retrieval cycle, inherited and refined from
the original Endeavor, creates a rhythm of investment and return that
rewards long-term planning over opportunistic play. Gray and de Visser
have built a game where the theme of scientific exploration is not
decorative but structural -- every system in the game is shaped by the
question of what it means to venture into the unknown, one depth zone
at a time.
