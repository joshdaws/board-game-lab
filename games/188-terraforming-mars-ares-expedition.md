### Theme Integration

Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition carries forward the parent game's
premise — corporations competing to make Mars habitable for human life —
but compresses it into a card-driven engine builder that plays in under
an hour. Players raise Mars's temperature, oxygen level, and ocean
coverage by playing project cards that represent technologies, biological
initiatives, industrial installations, and civic programs. The
terraforming theme remains structurally important: the three global
parameters (temperature, oxygen, oceans) function as shared progress
tracks that simultaneously measure the game's approach to its end
condition and provide scoring. Every card you play is framed as a
corporate investment in Mars's transformation, and the tension between
building your economic engine and actually advancing the terraforming
parameters captures the parent game's central thematic conflict — do you
invest in infrastructure or push for planetary change?

The card-only format sharpens the thematic focus on corporate research
and development. Without a physical board to place tiles on, the game
emphasizes the engine-building aspect of terraforming — the slow
accumulation of technologies, production chains, and synergistic projects
that make large-scale planetary engineering possible. Each card has a
color indicating its type: green cards are automated projects that
provide ongoing production, blue cards are active projects with abilities
you can trigger each round, and red cards are one-time events with
immediate effects. This tripartite structure models the three modes of
corporate activity: long-term infrastructure investment (green), ongoing
operational capacity (blue), and opportunistic tactical moves (red). The
card taxonomy makes strategic decisions legible — players can see at a
glance whether their tableau is weighted toward production, activation,
or burst effects.

The phase selection mechanism, borrowed from the Race for the Galaxy
lineage, adds a layer of social deduction to the terraforming theme.
Each round, every player secretly selects a phase to activate, and all
selected phases resolve for all players (with the selector receiving a
bonus). This models the competitive reality of corporate operations on
Mars: when one corporation decides it is time to build, all corporations
have the opportunity to build, but the initiator gets preferential
treatment. The phase system transforms what could be a parallel solitaire
into a reading game where anticipating opponents' phase selections is
critical to efficient play.

### Core Loop

The game plays over a series of rounds, each consisting of simultaneously
selected phases, until the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen,
oceans) are all maximized.

**PHASE SELECTION — SIMULTANEOUS**

1. Each player secretly selects one phase card from their hand of five
   phase cards:
   a) DEVELOPMENT — All players may play one green card from hand,
      paying its cost. The player who selected this phase gets a
      discount of 3 MC (MegaCredits) on the card played.
   b) CONSTRUCTION — All players may play one blue or red card from
      hand, paying its cost. The selector gets a discount of 3 MC.
   c) ACTION — All players may activate one or two blue card abilities
      from their tableau. The selector may activate one additional
      ability (up to three total).
   d) PRODUCTION — All players gain resources according to their
      production levels (MC, heat, plants, and any card-specific
      production). The selector gains 4 additional MC.
   e) RESEARCH — All players draw 2 cards and keep 1. The selector
      draws 5 cards and keeps 2.

2. Reveal all selected phases simultaneously. Only the phases that
   at least one player selected will activate this round. Phases
   that nobody selected are skipped entirely.

**PHASE RESOLUTION — In Phase Order (Development, Construction,
Action, Production, Research)**

For each activated phase:

1. All players may perform the phase's action.
2. The player(s) who selected that phase receive their bonus.
3. If multiple players selected the same phase, all of them receive
   the selector bonus.

**TERRAFORMING ACTIONS — During Play**

Throughout the game, certain cards and abilities advance the global
parameters:
   a) TEMPERATURE — Raise by spending 8 heat resources. Each step
      increases your Terraform Rating (TR) by 1.
   b) OXYGEN — Raise by spending 8 plant resources to place a
      greenery. Each step increases TR by 1.
   c) OCEANS — Certain cards and effects place ocean tiles. Each
      ocean increases TR by 1 and provides a placement bonus.

Terraform Rating is both your income base (TR equals MC production)
and your primary victory point track.

**End Game**: When all three global parameters reach their maximum,
complete the current round, then perform final scoring. Total score
equals TR plus VP from cards in tableau plus VP from end-game bonus
cards. Highest score wins.

### Key Design Patterns

PHASE SELECTION WITH UNIVERSAL ACTIVATION: The phase selection mechanism
is Ares Expedition's core structural innovation relative to its parent
game. Each round, every player selects one phase, and all selected phases
activate for everyone — but selectors receive bonuses. This creates a
social deduction layer: if you suspect two opponents will both select
Production, you can free-ride on their selection and choose a different
phase, effectively getting two phases' worth of benefit from one
selection. Conversely, selecting a phase nobody else chose means you are
the only player to act during that phase (with your bonus), gaining
exclusive tempo. The mechanism rewards reading opponents' tableau states
and hand positions to predict their selections, transforming engine
building from a solitary optimization into a multiplayer reading game.

MULTI-USE CARDS AS HAND MANAGEMENT: Every card in the game can be played
as a project (paying its cost for its effects), used as a discount during
the Development or Construction phase (some cards have alternate costs),
or simply held in hand as potential. The hand management tension — which
cards to play, which to hold, which to effectively discard by not
selecting the Research phase — is the game's primary decision space.
Because the card pool is large and draws are partially random, no two
games present the same hand management puzzle. The multi-use nature of
cards means that even a card you cannot afford to play has option value
as long as you hold it, creating a tension between the certainty of
playing a card now and the flexibility of keeping it for later.

ENGINE BUILDING WITH PRODUCTION RAMP: Green cards provide permanent
production bonuses that compound over the game's duration. An early
investment in MC production means more money every Production phase,
enabling more expensive cards in later rounds. An early investment in
plant production means faster oxygen advancement, which raises TR, which
increases MC production — creating a virtuous cycle. The engine-building
arc gives the game its satisfying trajectory: early rounds feel tight and
constrained, middle rounds see engines diverge and accelerate, and late
rounds feature powerful turns that chain multiple effects. The production
ramp is the game's primary reward mechanism, delivering the satisfaction
of watching a carefully constructed economic system come online.

TERRAFORM RATING AS DUAL-PURPOSE SCORE: TR functions as both your
income level (determining MC production each round) and your primary
victory point total. Advancing the global parameters raises your TR,
which means terraforming simultaneously scores points AND increases
your economic capacity. This dual purpose prevents the common
engine-building problem where players must choose between building their
engine and scoring points — in Ares Expedition, scoring points IS
building your engine. The design elegantly aligns player incentives
with the game's end condition: the actions that bring the game closer
to ending are the same actions that increase your score and income.

CARD COLOR TAXONOMY: The three card colors — green (automated/ongoing
production), blue (active/triggered abilities), and red (events/
one-time effects) — create a legible strategic vocabulary. A player
with many green cards has a strong production engine but limited
tactical flexibility. A player with many blue cards has powerful
activated abilities but may lack baseline production. A player who
plays many red cards gains immediate advantages but builds less
permanent infrastructure. The color system helps players read both
their own tableau and opponents' positions, enabling strategic
assessment without requiring memorization of individual card effects.

COMPRESSED PLAYTIME THROUGH SIMULTANEOUS PLAY: By having all players
act during every activated phase, Ares Expedition eliminates the
downtime that plagues the parent game. In original Terraforming Mars,
players take sequential turns, and a four-player game can exceed three
hours. In Ares Expedition, all players resolve each phase in parallel,
reducing playtime to 45-60 minutes regardless of player count. The
simultaneous structure also reduces the "watching others play" problem
— you are always engaged because every phase affects you. The
compression demonstrates that the core Terraforming Mars experience
(engine building, parameter advancement, card combos) can be delivered
in a fraction of the time without sacrificing strategic depth.

FREE-RIDING AS STRATEGIC DIMENSION: The phase selection system creates
a unique strategic dimension around free-riding. If you can predict
which phases opponents will select, you can avoid selecting those
phases yourself and choose a phase that only you need, effectively
gaining the benefit of two phases per round. Experienced players read
opponents' tableau compositions to predict phase selections —
a player with many blue cards likely wants Action; a player with high
production likely wants Production. This reading game adds an
interactive dimension to what is fundamentally a parallel engine
builder, and it rewards table awareness over pure optimization skill.

### What Makes It #188

Terraforming Mars: Ares Expedition answers the question that hung over
the original game's decade of dominance: can the Terraforming Mars
experience be delivered in under an hour? The answer is yes, through
the phase selection mechanism that replaces sequential turns with
simultaneous action. The game preserves the original's satisfying
engine-building arc and card combo discovery while eliminating its
biggest liability — excessive playtime and downtime in multiplayer.
The phase selection system adds a new strategic dimension (opponent
reading) that the original lacked, and the streamlined card taxonomy
makes the decision space more legible without reducing its depth. At
2.92 weight, it offers a genuine medium-weight strategic experience
rather than a simplified version of its parent, and its position at
#188 reflects a design that successfully extracted the essence of one
of the hobby's most popular games and delivered it in a form that
respects players' time.
