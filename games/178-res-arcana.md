### Theme Integration

Res Arcana casts players as rival mages competing to amass the most powerful
collection of magical artifacts, places of power, and monuments. The setting is
a fantasy world where five essence types --- Life (green), Death (black),
Elan (blue), Calm (gold), and Gold (the universal currency) --- represent
different schools of magical energy. Each artifact card depicts a specific
magical creation with evocative art and a name that hints at its function:
the Cursed Forge converts death essences into gold, the Windup Man generates
mechanical labor, the Dragon's Lair channels destruction into power. The theme
is not deeply simulative --- players are not casting spells or exploring
dungeons --- but it provides an internally consistent logic for why certain
conversions and combinations work. A card that turns Life essences into points
feels different from one that turns Death essences into points, even though
mechanically both are resource converters.

The game's most thematically resonant decision occurs at setup: each player
drafts a personal deck of exactly 8 artifact cards and receives a mage card
with a unique power. This tiny deck represents your mage's complete magical
repertoire. Unlike games where you draw from a shared deck and hope for useful
cards, in Res Arcana you know every card you will draw --- the only question
is the order. This creates the fantasy of a prepared wizard who has assembled
specific tools for a specific strategy, not a scavenger improvising with
whatever comes to hand. The draft ensures that your 8-card deck has internal
synergy, and the game is about deploying that synergy efficiently against
opponents doing the same.

The places of power --- shared locations that any player can claim by paying
their cost --- represent sites of magical significance in the world. The
Sunken Reef generates calm essences. The Catacombs of the Dead channel death
energy. The Sorcerer's Bestiary harnesses living creatures. These locations are
contested because only one player can own each one (or two in a 3-4 player
game), creating a land-rush dynamic that gives the fantasy world a sense of
scarcity and competition. The race to claim places of power before opponents
is the game's primary source of direct interaction and thematic drama.

### Core Loop

Players begin with a mage card (unique power), a personal deck of 8 artifact
cards (drafted before the game), a starting hand of 3 artifacts, and a small
pool of essences determined by the mage. The game proceeds in rounds, each
consisting of alternating turns until all players pass.

1. COLLECT ESSENCES --- At the start of each round, collect essences from all
   artifacts and places of power you control that have collection abilities.
   a) Artifacts with essence-generation icons produce their listed essences
   b) Places of power with collection abilities generate their outputs
   c) Your mage card may provide additional starting essences

2. TAKE TURNS (alternating, one action per turn until all pass) ---
   a) PLACE AN ARTIFACT --- Play an artifact card from your hand by paying its
      essence cost. The artifact enters play and is available for use from the
      next turn onward (or immediately if it has a "when placed" ability)
   b) USE A POWER --- Activate one of your artifacts, your mage, or a place
      of power you control. Each power can be used once per round (turned
      sideways to indicate use). Powers convert essences, generate essences,
      attack opponents, draw cards, or provide other effects
   c) CLAIM A PLACE OF POWER --- Pay the listed cost to take ownership of an
      unclaimed place of power from the central display. Places of power provide
      ongoing abilities and victory points
   d) PURCHASE A MONUMENT --- Pay the gold cost to buy a monument card from the
      display. Monuments provide only victory points (1-2 VP each) with no
      abilities
   e) DISCARD AN ARTIFACT --- Remove one of your played artifacts from the game
      to gain one gold or one essence of any type. A desperate move but
      sometimes necessary to fund a critical purchase
   f) PASS --- Declare that you are done for the round. You take no more actions
      this round but may still be affected by opponents' actions

3. CHECK FOR VICTORY --- After all players have passed, check if any player
   has 10 or more victory points (from places of power, monuments, and certain
   artifacts). If so, the player with the most VP wins. If no one has reached
   10, begin a new round.

4. RESET --- Straighten all turned powers. Draw one artifact card from your
   personal deck (if any remain). Essences on cards remain; the economy carries
   forward between rounds.

### Key Design Patterns

TINY DECK AS STRATEGIC COMPRESSION: Res Arcana's most radical design decision
is limiting each player to exactly 8 artifact cards for the entire game. Where
most card games generate variety through large decks and random draws, Res
Arcana generates depth through perfect information about your own capabilities.
You know every card you will draw; the strategic question is not what you will
get but how to deploy what you have in the optimal sequence. This compression
eliminates the "bad draw" frustration common in card games and replaces it with
a pure optimization puzzle. Every card in your deck matters because you have so
few. The draft that assembles the deck is itself a strategic phase where
players must evaluate synergies across just 8 cards --- a manageable but
deeply consequential decision space.

MULTI-USE CARDS AS DECISION DENSITY: Every artifact in Res Arcana serves
multiple functions. A card might generate essences on collection, provide an
activated power, contribute victory points, and serve as discard fodder for
gold. This multi-use design means that every card played creates several
ongoing decisions about how to use it each round. The decision density per card
is exceptionally high compared to games where cards have single effects. This
is how Lehmann achieves strategic depth with only 8 cards per player --- each
card carries enough decision weight to sustain multiple rounds of meaningful
play.

ESSENCE ECONOMY AS CONVERSION PUZZLE: The five essence types and gold create
a conversion economy where the challenge is not merely accumulating resources
but transforming them through chains of artifact abilities. A strong engine
might convert Life essences into Death via one artifact, then Death into Gold
via another, then Gold into a place of power. Finding efficient conversion
paths through your specific set of artifacts is the game's primary skill
expression. The economy is deliberately tight --- essences are scarce, and
most artifacts require specific types --- which forces players to optimize
every conversion rather than accumulating surplus.

RACE PACING AS GAME CLOCK: The 10-VP victory threshold combined with the
Race mechanic creates a self-regulating game length. Once any player approaches
10 VP, all other players face the urgency of either surpassing them or
blocking their access to remaining VP sources. The game typically ends in 4-6
rounds, which is remarkably short for the strategic weight it delivers. The
race pacing means there is no comfortable cruising phase --- from the second
round onward, every action is evaluated against the question of how quickly
it moves you toward 10 VP. Games that drag or stall are structurally
impossible because the victory threshold is always within reach.

OPEN DRAFTING AS METAGAME LAYER: The pre-game draft of artifact cards creates
a metagame layer where experienced players develop preferences for specific
card combinations and mage-artifact pairings. Because you see cards pass
through your hand during the draft, you gain partial information about
opponents' strategies. Drafting a card you do not need to deny it to an
opponent is a legitimate strategy, though the 8-card limit means every
denial costs you a potentially useful card. The draft transforms Res Arcana
from a tactical card game into a strategic one where the most important
decisions occur before the first round begins.

PLACES OF POWER AS CONTESTED OBJECTIVES: The central display of places of
power creates the game's primary interaction mechanism. Each place of power
provides both ongoing abilities and significant VP, making them essential to
any winning strategy. But they are limited --- typically one per player, with
only a subset available each game --- so claiming the right one at the right
time is critical. The cost to claim a place of power is steep, requiring
careful essence accumulation, and an opponent who claims the place you were
building toward can force a complete strategic pivot. This contested-objective
design creates tension and interaction in a game that is otherwise primarily
an engine-building exercise.

SCORE-AND-RESET AS COMPOUND INTEREST: The round structure, where essences
carry forward and artifacts accumulate, creates compound-interest dynamics.
An artifact placed in round one generates value across all subsequent rounds,
making early placement disproportionately powerful. The reset phase ---
straightening all used powers --- ensures that your engine fires every round,
and each round your engine is slightly larger than the last. This compound
growth means that the first two rounds feel like slow setup while rounds
four and five feel like explosive payoffs. The escalation curve is satisfying
because players feel their strategic investments bearing fruit.

### What Makes It #178

Res Arcana is a masterclass in strategic compression. Where most engine-building
games achieve depth through large card pools, complex supply chains, and
90-minute play times, Lehmann delivers comparable depth with 8 cards per player
in under an hour. The game's genius is recognizing that strategic richness
comes not from the number of components but from the number of meaningful
decisions per component. Every artifact, every essence, every round carries
weight because there is no slack in the system. The pre-game draft ensures
that each session presents a unique optimization puzzle, and the race pacing
prevents analysis paralysis from slowing the experience. At 2.66 weight,
Res Arcana occupies a rare position: it is accessible enough for a weeknight
game but deep enough that expert players consistently outperform newcomers,
and the tiny deck means that the gap between expert and novice lies entirely
in decision quality rather than deck luck. It is the tightest engine-building
game in the modern canon.
