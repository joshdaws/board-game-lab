### Theme Integration

Teotihuacan places players as scions of powerful noble families during the
construction of the great Pyramid of the Sun and the surrounding ceremonial
city. The Mesoamerican setting is not merely decorative — it permeates every
mechanical layer. Workers are represented as dice whose face values indicate
their power level (1-5), and when a die reaches power 6 it "Ascends,"
representing a worker who has gained enough spiritual authority to transcend
mortal labor. The Ascension mechanic — where the worker is reborn at the
Palace with power 1 and the player advances on the Avenue of the Dead —
fuses the Aztec cosmological concept of cyclical death and rebirth with a
mechanical reset that prevents any single worker from becoming permanently
dominant.

The eight Action Boards arranged in a circle around the Main Board form a
rondel that represents the districts of Teotihuacan: Palace, Forest, Stone
Quarry, Gold Deposits, Alchemy, Nobles, Decorations, and Construction. Each
district has a distinct economic function, and the clockwise movement of
workers around this rondel mirrors the flow of labor and resources through
the ancient city. The three temples — green, red, and blue — rising at the
board's edge represent competing religious institutions whose favor players
court through Worship actions. Temple advancement provides immediate rewards
and end-game scoring, reflecting the historical reality that religious
patronage was inseparable from political power in Teotihuacan.

The Pyramid itself is the game's physical centerpiece. Players contribute
Pyramid tiles that literally build a three-dimensional stepped structure over
the course of play. Placing tiles on the Construction Action Board scores
Victory Points based on the level, costs resources proportional to the
height, and awards additional points for matching iconography between tiles.
The act of collectively constructing this monument while individually
competing for glory within it perfectly captures the dual nature of ancient
civic projects: communal achievement serving private ambition.

### Core Loop

Play proceeds continuously in clockwise order without fixed rounds until an
Eclipse (scoring event) is triggered by the Calendar track:

**On Your Turn (choose one)**

1. TAKE A NORMAL TURN:
   a) SELECT A WORKER: Choose one of your unlocked workers (dice) and
      advance it 1, 2, or 3 Action Boards clockwise around the rondel.
   b) CHOOSE AN ACTION: Upon arriving at an Action Board, perform one of
      three possible actions:

      - COLLECT COCOA: Count the number of different colored unlocked
        workers already in the general area (plus your arriving worker).
        Gain that many cocoa plus one. This is the game's currency,
        required to pay for Main actions and Worship.

      - WORSHIP: Place your worker on a Worship space. Choose to activate
        the Worship ability, claim a Discovery tile (paying its cost), or
        pay 1 cocoa to do both. Advance on the corresponding temple and
        gain that step's reward. Worship locks the worker until freed.

      - PERFORM MAIN ACTION: Pay cocoa equal to the number of different
        colored unlocked workers already present (excluding the arriving
        worker). The specific Main action depends on the Action Board:
        * Forest (2): Gain wood based on worker count and power.
        * Stone Quarry (3): Gain stone based on worker count and power.
        * Gold Deposits (4): Gain gold based on worker count and power.
        * Alchemy (5): Acquire a Technology tile, paying gold.
        * Nobles (6): Build a Building, score VP, advance Avenue of Dead.
        * Decorations (7): Add a Decoration tile to the Pyramid.
        * Construction (8): Add Pyramid tiles to the Pyramid structure.

   c) POWER UP: After performing any Main action, power up one worker on
      that Action Board. If you have 3+ workers there, power up twice.
      If a worker reaches power 6, it immediately Ascends.

2. UNLOCK ALL WORKERS FOR FREE: Instead of a normal turn, you may
   unlock all locked workers (moving them from Worship spaces to general
   areas). Alternatively, pay 3 cocoa during a normal turn to unlock.

**After Your Turn**: If you hold the Last Player token, advance the light
Calendar disc by one space. This may trigger an Eclipse.

**Eclipse (Scoring)**

When the Calendar disc reaches the dark disc marker:
1. Score VP for Buildings row (lowest visible number on Main Board).
2. Score 4 VP for the player furthest ahead on the Pyramid track.
3. Score VP for each step on the Pyramid track (4/3/2 for 1st/2nd/3rd
   Eclipse).
4. Reset Pyramid track markers.
5. Score masks in sets (1/2/3/4/5/6/7 masks = 1/3/6/10/15/21/28 VP).
6. Pay salary: 1 cocoa per worker + additional cocoa for high-power
   workers. Lose 3 VP for each unpaid cocoa.
7. Reset Calendar and adjust dark disc for next Eclipse.

The game ends after the third Eclipse (or when the Pyramid is completed).

### Key Design Patterns

DICE-AS-WORKERS WITH POWER PROGRESSION: The most distinctive design element
is using dice as workers where the face value represents accumulated
expertise. Workers start at power 1-3 and grow through the Power Up
mechanic after Main actions. Higher power unlocks stronger rows on resource
Action Boards and allows access to more valuable Technology tiles. But power
6 triggers Ascension — a forced reset that returns the die to the Palace at
power 1. Tascini created a natural growth-and-rebirth cycle that prevents
any single worker from becoming an unstoppable engine piece. The player must
constantly balance the benefit of powering up (stronger actions) against
the cost of Ascension (temporary loss of a productive worker). This tension
gives every power-up decision stakes that simple worker placement lacks.

RONDEL MOVEMENT AS OPPORTUNITY COST: Workers must move 1-3 spaces clockwise
around the eight Action Boards, and they can never stay in place. This rondel
constraint means accessing a specific Action Board requires planning several
turns in advance. If your worker is on Construction (8) and you need Forest
(2), you must travel through six boards to reach it — or use a different
worker. The rondel transforms spatial position into temporal planning: where
your workers sit now determines what you can do for the next several turns.
Combined with the cocoa cost that scales with other players' presence, the
rondel creates a dynamic where timing your visits to avoid crowded boards is
as important as choosing which action to take.

COCOA AS UNIVERSAL LUBRICANT: Cocoa functions as the game's universal
currency — required for Main actions (paying for other workers' presence),
unlocking workers, Worship costs, and salary during Eclipse. The Collect
Cocoa action scales with board diversity (more different-colored workers
present means more cocoa), creating a positive externality: other players'
presence on a board makes cocoa collection more valuable but Main actions
more expensive. This dual pressure — cocoa as both reward and cost —
ensures players cannot ignore the economic layer. Running out of cocoa is
catastrophic: you cannot act, and you lose Victory Points during Eclipse
salary. The cocoa economy is the regulatory mechanism that prevents any
single strategy from dominating.

PYRAMID AS SHARED CONSTRUCTION PUZZLE: The physical Pyramid is not just
thematic decoration — it is a spatial optimization puzzle that rewards
planning. Tiles can only be placed at specific levels based on the number
of supporting tiles beneath them and the progress of Decoration tiles.
Each placement scores Victory Points based on the level (1/3/5/7 for levels
1-4), advances the Pyramid track, and awards bonus points for matching
icons between the newly placed tile and the tiles it covers. The player who
places the capstone tile triggers the game's end and forces an immediate
final Eclipse. This creates a race dynamic layered on top of the economic
engine: pushing the Pyramid forward accelerates the endgame, and players
must decide whether to rush completion or develop their engine further.

TEMPLE TRACKS AS PARALLEL SCORING PATHS: The three temples provide an
alternative Victory Point pathway that intersects with every Action Board.
Each Worship action advances one temple, and advancement through resource-
gathering boards (Forest, Stone Quarry, Gold Deposits) also triggers temple
advances. Minor steps provide immediate rewards (resources, cocoa); major
steps offer Discovery tiles or end-game scoring conditions via Temple Bonus
tiles. The temple system ensures that even players focused on resource
gathering or Pyramid construction are rewarded for occasional devotional
side trips. It also creates blocking opportunities: only one player can
occupy the topmost step of each temple, making temple racing a source of
direct competition in an otherwise largely indirect game.

ECLIPSE TIMING AS STRATEGIC LEVER: The Calendar track that triggers Eclipses
is advanced only by the Last Player (the player who acts last in initial
turn order). But any player can accelerate it by completing the Pyramid or
through Ascension. The three-Eclipse structure creates natural Act breaks
where mask collections are scored, salaries are paid, and Pyramid progress
is evaluated. Players who collect many masks want Eclipses to arrive
quickly; players building expensive engines want them delayed. The tension
between these preferences — and the limited ability to influence Eclipse
timing — creates a meta-game of pacing that operates above the tactical
turn-by-turn decisions.

TECHNOLOGY TILES AS ENGINE CUSTOMIZATION: The nine Technology tiles acquired
through the Alchemy Action Board provide permanent rule-breaking abilities
that let players specialize their strategies. Each tile modifies how a
specific action works — gaining extra resources, reducing costs, providing
alternative scoring — and the gold cost ensures they require deliberate
investment. The randomized availability of Technology tiles means optimal
strategies shift between games, preventing solved meta-strategies. Tascini
used Technologies as the game's primary source of replayability: the
combinatorial space of which six tiles appear (from nine) and which players
acquire them creates a different strategic landscape each session.

### What Makes It #107

Teotihuacan achieves the rare feat of making a rondel-based worker placement
game feel narratively coherent. The dice-as-workers system is not a gimmick
but a genuine design innovation: the power progression creates a growth arc
for each worker that mirrors the rising ambition of the noble families
players represent. The Pyramid construction provides both a spatial puzzle
and a pacing mechanism, while the temple tracks and mask collection offer
enough scoring diversity that no single path dominates. Tascini's
achievement is integration — every subsystem (cocoa economy, rondel
movement, power progression, Eclipse timing) feeds into every other,
creating a web of interdependencies that rewards long-range planning while
remaining responsive to the tactical realities of a shared, crowded board.
